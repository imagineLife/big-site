# Text Indexes

Text gets stored.  
Sometimes, searching by WORDS in the fields could be helpful and needed.  
As a user, we CAN search for exact string matches, or regex matches or other ways. Mongo gives built-in regex support!

This is not optimal performance, though.

Text indexes are similar to multi-key indexes, in that they make a ....lot....of....indexes.

## Creating a text index

```js
db.products.createIndex({ productName: 'text' });
```

Notice the value of the key is `text`, wherease if the value were a 1 or a -1 the index would expect to be numerical and sorted.

When creating an index like this, _each word in the text field string creates a unique index_...
...lotta words === lotta indexes

- spaces && hyphens are text delimiters
- each indexed text, by default, is case insensitive and gets indexed lowercase

This allows leverage of text-searching without collection-scanning -

```js
db.products.find({ $text: { $search: 'some text here' } });
```

## CONS

- lotta indexes
- long time to insert
- long time to BUILD the indexes
- decrease WRITE performance, as the indexes need to be created && maintained

## Navigate text indexes with compound indexes

Create a compound index and leverage the compound field to reduce the index scanning going on when leveraging the text field index:

```js
// compound index with text 2nd
db.product.createIndex({ category: 1, productName: 'text' });

// a search leveraging the compound index to reduce index scanning
db.product.find({ category: 'drink', $text: { $search: 'soda' } });
```

This limits text-keys searching when querying. The above find query limits text-searches to text string in the `drink` category, ignoring all other index keys in all other categories.

## Searching for text

```js
// insert 2 similar text-field docs
db.product.insert({productName: "Tasty clear soda"})
db.product.insert({productName: "Tasty clear vodka"})

// create text index
db.product.createIndex({productName: "text"})

// search
db..product.find({$text: {$search: {"Tasty soda"}}})

// will return both docs....
```

This return may result in confusion:  
**Mongo defaults to an `OR` when searching for text: `Tasty` OR `soda`.**
When looking for `tasty soda`, really looking for any doc that includes `tasty` OR `soda`.

### Leverage the SCORE

Maybe try getting & projecting the textScore val per results.  
The `textScore` will show a 0 - to - 1 matching "percentage" result of the query.

```js
// search

db..product.find({
  $text: {
    $search: {"Tasty soda"}
  }
}, {
  score: { $meta: 'textScore' }
})

/*
  will return a matching score key/val, 0 - 1, for each result
  maybe even sort by matching percentage
  then the higher matches return first
*/

db.product.find({
  $text: {
    $search: "Tasty soda"
  }
}, {score: {$meta: "textScore"}}).sort({score: {$meta: 'textScore'}})

```

### Indexes, Performance, and Regex

Make regex searches as explicit as possible.

- leverage a starting force `/^kirby/` to match at the beginning of a string
  - this will ignore all "branches of the Index b-tree" that don't start with the `kirby` text
  - `/^.irby/` is not NEARLY as performant as this wildcard regex `/^kirby/`

Mongo has built-in regex support.

### Creating the index

Note, the "text" keyword is used and the order is not described. In other indexes, the order/direction is described in declaring the index.

- allows this special text index
- allows full-text-search capabilities while _avoiding collection scans_
- works similar to multi-key indexes
