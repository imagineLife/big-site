# New Method

Hybrid index builds do the best of 2 worlds:

- PERFORMANCE: previous foreground indexes were fast && Hybrid index builds are fast too
- EFFECTIVE: previous foreground index builds made the best btrees. Hybrid index builds do the same
- NON-BLOCKING: previous background index builds were non-blocking, and hybrid index builds are also non-blocking
