# MongoDB Users And Roles

**Built-In Roles**:  
There are a bunch of [built-in Roles](/mongo/roles/built-in) that MongoDB offers. Roles are permissions to take actions, and mongodb offers a BUNCH of built-in roles. Mongo breaks up their roles into role categories - each of these is a grouping of user roles:

- [DB User](/mongo/roles/db-user): these can be setup for clients who perform normal db operations
- [DB Admin](/mongo/roles/db-user):
- [Cluster Admin](/mongo/roles/cluster-admin)
- [Backups & Restoration](/mongo/roles/backup-restore)
- [SuperUser](/mongo/roles/super-user)
- [SuperUser](/mongo/roles/super-user)
