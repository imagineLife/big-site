# relationships

**NOTE**: when referencing documents between collections, WATCH OUT for the `_id` field: it is default to the mongodb ObjectId(etc) and may not work as a reference from other document `employee_id` or `job_id` type string or number fields.

The better the model, the better the performance.
Relationships in a data model are where entities and how the entities "connect".

## One to One

Usually, a single document has all 1-to-1 relationships.  
person, person_id.  
grouping entities within a doc.

### Embedding

Embedding is often compared against "linking" data, as a rdbms does. Embedding...

- puts fields at the same level
- puts groups of docs inside of a parent doc

The easiest and quickest way to store data is to embed data in documents. Embedding data will build large and complex documents over time. Luckily, the [maximum BSON document size limit](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/document/#document-size-limit) is 16MB, so there may be plenty of room in a document to store a lot of data and leverage proper indexing to reference document parts quickly.

#### Choosing Embedding over Linking

Linking and embedding can both be done in documents, so there are no clear "rules" for choosing one over the other.

To choose to embed over linking documents, a few questions will be helpful to consider, as their answers can give insight in to the choice to embed over linking:

- **How often does the "related" data get accessed?**
  - the more often the "related" data gets access, the more value the query will serve by having documents embedded
    - if a "book" document contains embedded "summary" data, and the summary is queried often, then the embedded "summary" doc will be directly available through the book doc
    - if a "book"
- **Do queries on the data use the embedded info in the queries?**
- **Does the "related" data change often?**
  - The more often the "related" data changes, the less valuable embedding may be
  - Perhaps the embedded information stores comprehensive representations of "other" data that changes often,
    - LINK: i.e a "books" collection that embeds "author" data where the author data changes every week due to author blogpost updates, but the book data changes every several years when new releases of the book come out. Perhaps storing a reference ID to an "authors" collection would be better here
    - EMBED: perhaps a list of "data snapshots" get released weekly related to a pizza-delivery service, and the application shows last 12 weeks of "data highlights" per driver - storing the last 12 "data snapshots" in a "drivers" collection, and even "rotating" them in the drivers collection, makes querying the last-12 weeks tightly connected to driver data

### Referencing

- same ID would have to live in different docs 1x
  Example, `person`, and `person_details`. Doing this will add complexity to data management. This should only be done for schema optimization reasons.

## One to Many

Example: one person, many purchase receipts.
One-to-zillion is used when talking big data.
One object is related to many others.  
"Top Reviews".  
"Data highlights".  
"Quick View Analytics".
One-to-many can have some duplication - this can sometimes be preferable.
**Embed** when there are frequently-queried-together elements.  
**Reference** when the related docs are not always needed or not often queried together.

### Embed

Embed the most-queried one-to-many entities.  
The info that is needed together stays together.  
Querying the many embedded element, we use multi-key indexes. Index the array.

**example**  
An order, some items, a shipping address and a customer.  
Most of this data could be stored in an `orders` object.  
Order, with sub-doc of items (_items in the order_) and shipping address. When the items + shipping address don't change much, the data should be nested.

### Reference

Referencing in the "many" side.  
The "one" side could have an arr of references to the "many" elements by id: a zipcode(one) object has a store_ids(many) array.

## Many To Many

Many products, Many purchase invoices.

Consider using [min, likely, max] to describe data relationships.

### Lookup tables

Leverage a "lookup" style table that hold the relationships.  
This makes data migration complex in relational dbs.

### Mongo and many to many

Can _copy_ a many item to each related element.  
The COST here is that when changing the copy, many docs need adjusting.  
The storage that fits queries is the best storage.

#### Embed

Here, an arr of docs in each side of the relationship.
Usually, only the most-queried part of the relationship really matters.  
As an example, in a `cart` doc, all `items` can be stored in the cart, as the items are generally ALWAYS retrieved along side the `cart`.  
`items` also are stored in their own documents, as the `item` might have specific use-cases outside of `carts`.

#### Reference

Here, an arrays live in BOTH sides of the relationship.
As an example, references between `items` docs and `stores` that carry the items. The `items` and have a `sold_at` array storing store ids. The `store` documetns each can have a `store_id` that the `items` use as references. The `store` docs also store an array of `items_sold`.

## One To Zillion

[see](https://www.vertabelo.com/blog/crow-s-foot-notation) some explanation of relationship diagrams, including "crows feet".  
More than 1-to-10K.  
Same as `one-to-many`, just more descriptive.  
A notation for describing cardinalities is helpful to describe the documents in the relationship: `[0,1K, 100M]`: [`min`,`most-likely`, `max`] number of docs in the relationship of the `zillion`.
Help devs & add comments in code to the `zillion` table.
