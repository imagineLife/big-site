# Identify the workload

Example:

- an IoT EDB
- 100 million weather sensors sending data
- collect the data
- make it available to 10 data scientists
- MOST trends can be deduced hourly
- no logs or stats to leverage
- data can be collected and sent 1x per minute
- need to keep data for more than 10 years
- ops team needs to validate faulty devices
- ops team needs to be able to aggregate data for the data scientists
- data scientists need to explore and find trends
