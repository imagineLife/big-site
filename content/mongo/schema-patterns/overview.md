# Patterns

There are several "patterns" for storing related data.

## Extended Reference

Carry SOME details of one dataset into another.  
When there are many "joins" going in, consider bringing frequently-accessed fields from the joined collections into the mainly-accessed collection.

## Subset

Sort of like an extended reference.  
Useful when a LARGE portion of data is in a doc that is rarely used. When a doc size starts getting large, introduce this subset idea.

## Computed

## Polymorphic

## Attribute

## Bucket
