# Facets
An analytics capability.  
Data usually has to meet multiple SLAs.  
Facet navigation - 
- create in interface that characterizes query results across multiple dimensions
- users can narrow results by selecting facet values as a filter
- this can be used for browsing data catalogues, analyzing data

Example:
- a user catalogue for LinkedIn
  - search the catalogue
    - users with term of mongodb
    - **can add facets**
      - location

## Single Facet Queries
Example: an app has a search bar.  
The app returns some results on search.  
The app also has _filters_, _dimensions_ of search.  

Explore the `startups` dataset.  
Get `factes` out of the data.
