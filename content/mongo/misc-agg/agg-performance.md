# aggregation performance
Consider 2 "categories" of aggregation queries: real-time && batch.

## RealTime Processing
This gives data to apps.  
Performance is important.  
Users may run these by a triggered action.  

## Batch processing  
This is a category for running analytics.  
These results may not even be read immediately after running.  
The performance may not matter as much as real-time processing.
