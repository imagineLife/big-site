# Intro To Dependencies, npm, and package.json
Dependencies in javascript projects are ubiquitous.  
There are [devDependencies](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#devdependencies): ones that are only needed during development, and not in a production environment.  
There are [dependencies](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#dependencies), the ones needed for a prod env.  
These are managed with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm), "_the worlds largest software registry_".
