# Data Types In JavaScript
Javascript stores data, information, in a bunch of different ways.  

## Primitives Are The Root
Primitive data types represent the "lowest level" types of data in JS.  
Other data types exist & are more-or-less composed of these datatypes. 

### Numbers 
### BigInts
### Strings
### Boolean
### Symbols
### Undefined
### Null

## Composed Data Types, or Objects
"Composed" is not an official term (_I don't believe_). Many documents refer to how all data types that are not primitives are objects.  
Each data type does have unique properties, use-cases, syntaxes, etc.  


### Objects
### Functions
### Arrays
