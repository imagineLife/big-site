## Prerequesites
Run this on a windows machine. The syntax for windows cmd is not transferrable to a mac or linux env.  
Have python installed on your windows machine. The version of python this is assuming is version 3.x.x.  


## Steps
### Open a Terminal and Navigate to your Desktop
### Create a Python File  
### Create the Python Program
### Run the Python Program  

## Next Steps
Get some DB Connection parameters.  
Look up how to connect to a database using python.  
Make a new program file, `connect-to-db.py` and add some code that will connect to a db and query a table for some "simple" data.  
Have the program "print" some db results after querying the db.  
Run the program.
