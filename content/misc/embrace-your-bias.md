## Each One Of Us Is Figuring Things Out
We Gather facts: **assmebling knowledge**.  
We make connections out of the info we've gathered, **assuming meaning**.  
We respond to the meaning, **asserting our will**, one way or another.   
I've personally begun to consider this type of "framework" from [Buster Benson](#reference), particularly in the context of managing arguments.  

### We Assemble Knowledge
There is a lot of information out there.  
Consider something that requires action, like which car to buy:
- local dealers may be available for consultations
- articles a-plenty can be found "_the top 24 (any vehicle type) to buy this year_"
- video reviews of cars can be found, even ones that cover 
#### We Make Shortcuts Assembling Knowledge
There are a bunch of "ways" that we might "shortcut" this information gathering process...
- Let me gather content related to 1 specific top across candidates (_i.e any "hot topic" of the moment_) rather than gathering all info about all topics for all candidates
- Let me look into the few candidates just within the party I'm already affiliated with
- Let me "time box" this - I'm not going to do this all night long - I have other things to do (_have you SEEN the ["Life Uncontained" youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-l69It3hxAY3tkBH_utLNQ)?! FASCINATING!_)
