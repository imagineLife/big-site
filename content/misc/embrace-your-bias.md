## Each One Of Us Is Figuring Things Out
We Gather facts: **assmebling knowledge**.  
We make connections out of the info we've gathered, **assuming meaning**.  
We respond to the meaning, **asserting our will**, one way or another.   

Consider "free time" and what to do with it...
- read one of the several books on my list
- invest in my body through meaningful physical activity & healthy(er) meal prep
- reach out to that friend I've been thinking of, see where that leads
- "get ahead" at work with some extra time invested
- try out the hobby I've been curious about
- clean up this mess
- do something special for my partner

Each of these may require assembling knowledge about a something(s), which takes time, energy and willingness. 
### We Assemble Knowledge
There is a lot of information out there - probably "too much" to handle. Consider a topic like voting during a "mid-term election", and some of the knowledge than can be gathered...
- Who are all the candidates in each role? 
- What roles are up for election?
- What does each role MEAN?! and DO?!
- What does each candidate "stand for"?
- What values, objectives and goals do I personally hope folks in those roles would do and stand for?
- Where do I vote? When? Am I registered where I currently live?

#### We Make Shortcuts Assembling Knowledge
There are a bunch of "ways" that we might "shortcut" this information gathering process...
- Let me gather content related to 1 specific top across candidates (_i.e any "hot topic" of the moment_) rather than gathering all info about all topics for all candidates
- Let me look into the few candidates just within the party I'm already affiliated with
- Let me "time box" this - I'm not going to do this all night long - I have other things to do (_have you SEEN the ["Life Uncontained" youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-l69It3hxAY3tkBH_utLNQ)?! FASCINATING!_)
