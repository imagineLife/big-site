# Use JS

Maybe this is a 'pitch' to an invisible person.  
Maybe JavaScript is just not interesting or exciting even valid to 'backend' and/or db engineers.  
Maybe

## Break The Language Barrier

Using JavaScript across a Frontend, API, Database and more can do wonders for a project.  
Multiple language syntax details don't need to be one of the details that software developers are managing.  
Need to update the Client? [Use JS for the browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).  
Need to update the data handling between the db & UI? [Use](https://nodejs.org/en/) [JavaScript](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/) [on](https://socket.io/) [the](https://expressjs.com/) [server](https://hapi.dev/).  
Need to adjust how data is stored? JS for a datastore (_mongodb_).  
Need to run some machine learning? [Use](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) [JavaScript](https://ml5js.org/) [for](http://caza.la/synaptic/#/) [that](https://brain.js.org/#/), too.  
Need to build tests for an application? [There are](https://jestjs.io/) [plenty](https://mochajs.org/) [of](https://www.cypress.io/) [options](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) for that too!

## Master One Before Passing with Many

Surely [polyglot programmers](https://www.stxnext.com/blog/polyglot-programming/) [are](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2467812/polyglot-programming----development-in-multiple-languages.html) [the](https://hub.packtpub.com/polyglot-programming-allows-developers-to-choose-the-right-language-to-solve-tough-engineering-problems/) [people](https://cult.honeypot.io/reads/become-a-polyglot-developer/#:~:text=Polyglot%20programming%20is%20generally%20defined,available%20in%20a%20single%20language.%E2%80%9D) [we](https://deanwampler.github.io/polyglotprogramming/) [all](https://medium.com/@guestposts_92864/what-is-a-polyglot-programmer-and-why-you-should-become-one-e5629bf720c2) [want](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-become-a-polyglot-programmer-fff48562e708) to be and become. But based on the bits that I'm familiar with regarding JavaScript alone (_[OOP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS) and [FP](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/functional-javascript/9781449360757/) can both be accomplished, [event-driven software](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html), vertical scaling with [child-processes](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html) or [clusters](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html), [Prototypical Inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain), [managing streams of data](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html), [mongodb's mql](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/introduction/), and more_), as well as the plethora of already-put-together modules in the npm ecosystem, there is more than enough to learn and use that can provide functionality across a stack of needs.  

Mastering some details about one language can allow for easier translation to other langauges - lists of data types, sync vs async, process flow, networking, file-system parsing, handling streams, cryptography, type definitions (_ts_), scoping, functional programming, object-oriented programming... if things like these make sense in 1 language they will probably be easier to "mind map" the similarities into other languages. If these things _are not clear in 1 language_, adding another language might only confuse what is going on.
