## Break The Language Barrier

Using JavaScript across a Frontend, API, Database and more can do wonders for a project.  
Multiple language syntax details don't need to be one of the details that software developers are managing.  
Need to update the Client? [Use JS for the browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).  
Need to update the data handling between the db & UI? [Use](https://nodejs.org/en/) [JavaScript](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/) [on](https://socket.io/) [the](https://expressjs.com/) [server](https://hapi.dev/).  
Need to adjust how data is stored? JS for a datastore (_mongodb_).  
Need to run some machine learning? [Use](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) [JavaScript](https://ml5js.org/) [for](http://caza.la/synaptic/#/) [that](https://brain.js.org/#/), too.

## Master One Before Fumbling with Many

But based on the bits that I'm familiar with regarding JavaScript alone (_oop + fp can both be accomplished, event-driven software, vertical scaling with child-processes, Prototypical Inheritance, managing streams of data, mongodb's mql, and more_), there is enough to know that can provide functionality
