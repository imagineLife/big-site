 # Learn
 Stay learning.  

 ## Learn From Many
 Checking out a new topic? Try "hearing from" several people on the topic.  
 People have different opinions, communication styles, tidbits of knowledge nad experience, etc. Hearing from many will help "solidify" concepts and details.  

 ## Use Your Senses
 ### Listen  
 Listen to people talk.  

### Read
There are an abundance of blogs, websites, books & tools. Use em.  

### Teach
Show someone else what you are learning.  
There is a simple concept that you can help someone else as long as you have only 1 more day's experience than them. Use that.  
Explain a nuance to someone who already knows what you're learning.  
Explain what you're learning in a "dumbed down" way to someone who will never be interested in the details.  

### Do  
Make something.  
Apply the learning knowledge somehow - this might be one of the most effective ways to make a nealy-learned detail "stick".
