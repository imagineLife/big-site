## Know Your Stuff

Certifications can be great, even in tech. Certs can help:

**Validate Competence & Build Trust**  
Prove a "level" of proficiency in a given technology.  
Communicate to yourself and to others a learned & known set of skills in a particular area.

**Do Work & Contribute to Stability**  
Learning details during a certification & preparation can ensure that tasks can be accomplished successfully with a depth-of-knowledge provided by the training.  
Reliable work is important.

**Grow**  
Learn more. Do More.  
Become more than you were yesterday.

## Certification Skeptics In Tech

**The Landscape Is Always Changing**  
Technology is always moving, and tech is always changing. Even a single "tool" that is heavily depended on [will probably](https://nodejs.org/tr/blog/uncategorized/10-lts-to-12-lts/) [at some point](https://nextjs.org/docs/upgrading#breaking-changes) [have](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#1600-september-26-2017) [breaking](https://docs.mongodb.com/v5.0/reference/versioned-api/?_ga=2.5453744.2077386325.1639572064-1242320383.1493999732) [changes](https://jestjs.io/blog/2020/05/05/jest-26#other-breaking-changes-in-jest-26), contributing to a valid cert today becoming outdated tomorrow.

**The Test Might Not Be Valuable**  
Knowing what a certification "tests" is often hidden. Was the test easy enough to google all the answers?
Was the test deep enough to "really" test for deep knowledge?
