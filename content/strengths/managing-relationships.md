# Building Relationships
## The Talents
Some folks shine by identifying _other people_ - maybe suggesting how each person in a group can contribute meaningfully.  
Some are great teachers - enjoying the process of helping someone get from point a to z.  
Some have a magnetic empathy - easy to talk to, easy to feel understood by.  
Some folks have a magnetically positive vibe - cracking a great joke, keeping a heavy conversation light, wearing life a little looser than the rest of us...  
Others are flexible to fill a gap where needed.
