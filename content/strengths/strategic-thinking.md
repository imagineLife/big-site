# Strategic Thinking
## The Talents
Some folks seems to have a knack for thinking.  
Some folks are great at daydreaming about the future: what could be, how compelling the next step feel, etc.  
Others are skilled at relating a current situation to something else to ease discomfort in a room - a room of folks just starting might be _like_ planting some seed where we don't know if all the seeds will grow as expected.  
Others bring interesting details to the table - historical references, relational nuiances, socio-economical informed variants...  
Others thrive in deep and complex "heady" converstaions.
