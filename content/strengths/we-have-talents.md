People throughout my life have exemplified talents.  
Sometime these talents are clear and more easily identifiable than others.  
Other times, the talents of others have seemed more subtle, mysterious, sometimes even confusing.

## When Connecting Ideas Makes Things Simpler

Alice has an uncanny talent for drawing connections between topics. She'll be in a conversation about a topic & can offer parallels between a current problem and another solution.  
We've talked about organizing databases and Alice has enlightened the room with a connected idea about segregating for security reasons, and the data model was changed.  
We've been building relationships between data and Alice has been able to plant a seed for a one-size-fits-all extraction and the data model became simpler and better.  
These connected ideas have been helpful for getting out of 'ruts' that we haven't even known we were in.

## When The Moment Is Critical

Bill is always present, living for the current moment. Bill makes a choice and makes it happen immediately.  
When a fire is burning, Bill is there. There are no strategies that get in the way. There are no ill feelings toward what others might consider a roadblock to getting something done.  
This moment-focused talent has proven critical for making things happen amidst the requests from many. Some folks stall, overcomplicate, or might get overwhelmed by immediate needs. Bill's "now"-focused mentality serves these moments well.

## A Lover of the Journey

With a seemingly unquenchable hunger for more, Jessica is always honing her craft. She doesn't settle with what she knows, and loves the work of gaining knowledge.  
This drive beyond the goal has proven to be a helpful approach to life where she is always a 'student', even with much knowledge accumulated.

### The Trailblazer

Mark always took action as a first resort. Growth required an immediate next step. Waiting, pausing, or stalling were never the best options.  
This fire-aim-ready style can serve as the spark to a room full of ideas who may seem 'stuck' ideating and need this boost to take some first steps.
