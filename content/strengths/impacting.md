# Making An Impact

Turning ideas into tangible to-do items.  
Having a clear and tangible presence.  
"Driving the Train".  
Making a decision when others are stalling or confused or lingering.  
Translating good into great.  
Organizing projects by levels of impactfulness.  


Some folks have a natural "knack" for making an impact.    

_This is heavily influenced by learnings from and an appreciation for [Clifton Strengths](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths)_.
