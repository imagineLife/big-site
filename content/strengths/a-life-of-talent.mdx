# A Life Of Talent

## We Have Talents Individually

I have a tendency to gather information. This has been useful when I happen to have some info that myeslf or someone else was looking for.
My wife has a talent for getting things done through a schedule. This has served her and others well by crafting helpful schedules that help get longer-term goals accomplished.
A friend of mine has a seeminly natural skill for describing what the future can look like for himself and others. This has served himself and other by contributing to a sense of purpose that connects to something broader than the current details of the day.

- everyone has variation in talents
- we can know and name talents that resonate with us
- sometimes our talents can feel uncomfortable
- there is enough room for us and others to have different talents
- we can operate from a place fundamentally sourced from talent
