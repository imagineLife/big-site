# An Intro To Algorithms
Algorithms can help developers understand data structures and ways to logically "deal with" different use-cases and build-or-use data structures that serve unique purposes:
- do I need ordered data? unordered data?
- do I need to organize the data? (_sorting_)
- how often do I need to _access_ parts of the data, like the oldest and newest data elements?  

During regular development lifecycles of an employed engineer, it is probably not common for software engineers to _build or use_ some of the "low level" algorithms that are often talked about during interviews or algorithm learning certificates/courses. This might make mastering algorithms seem like a conflict-of-interest: `why do I need to learn how to do these seemingly low-level complicated things when I can just build functioning software?!`.  

I like what [The Primeagen says in his Frontend Masters Course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/), that algorithms are something like a "secret handshake" during the interview process of a software engineer. There might be a bit of a strategic reason to learn these things: to get past some technical interviews and get into the "real work" of software engineering. Even if this were _the only reason_ to learn algorithms, to pass a technical interview, I imagine that coding algorithms can then seem like a valuable skill to learn.

## Builing Search
Searching through data can be complex.  
Building search algorithms is a common task, as there are several ways to search through data.  

## Sorting Data
Sorting data can be complex.  
Building sorting algorithms is a common task, as there are several ways to sort data: some more efficiently than others.    

## Storing Data (Data structures)
