# Initializing the Client Directory

Here, a directory will be setup to contain some "framework" details for a client-side frontend build system.  
A primary goal here is to leverage webpack for "bundling" some react dev code into production-ready static html/js/css.  
This will include

- setting up a directory and initializing as an npm repo
- installing dependencies like react, webpack, babel, and other related dependencies
- building a simple react component
- building the parts needed to transform react code into production-ready static assets
