    "From the outside-in, this layout contains a wrapping div. This has minimal constraining styles.",
    "Inside the wrapping div are 2 sections. These have 100% width, some padding & margins, display set to flex and the flex alignment set at the element start.",
    "The widths of each section/column are set to my liking here & the important detail about column widths is that here the combined width is 100% of the available space.",
    "The first section, the left column, has position set to sticky. The section has a fixed height in this case. The div has a 100% width with max-width @ 40%.",
    "The second section, the right column, has a fixed height in this case to 800px. The section has width set to 100% with max-width set to 60%."
