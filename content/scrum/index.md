## Thoughts on Scrum

The framework of Scrum is a set of artifacts, roles and events.  
As the guide reads,  
"_While implementing only parts of Scrum is possible, the result is not Scrum. Scrum exists only in its entirety and functions well as a container for other techniques, methodologies, and practices._"

### Theories

Without the theories and values as the foundations of Scrum, the artifacts, roles and events can end up hollow.

### Values

Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect and Courage

### Team

3 role types make up a scrum team: a Scrum Master, a Product Owner, and a Development Team

### Events

A Sprint, Sprint Planning, a Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, & Sprint Retrospective

### Artifacts

A Product Backlog, a Sprint Backlog, an Increment, and a Definition of Done
