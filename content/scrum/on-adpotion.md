# On Advocacy

Scrum needs a champion in order for an org and the scrum team(s) to adopt the values, artifacts and practices.  
On paper, the Scrum Master fills this role. The Scrum Master can be empowered to facilitate advocacy, education, and process review sessions to both the Scrum Team as well as those outside the scrum team - stakeholders, C-Suite folks, other teams, etc.

## Advocacy for the Scrum Team

The Developers don't need to focus on details of Scrum. Developers focus is to develop. Scrum is the framework to enable the work of the Develops to be done incrementally and to produce smaller low-risk bits of value in exchange for longer-waited-for riskier releases.

### Scrum as the empowerment tool for devs

For developers, scrum is an **empowering process framework** for devs to do what they do best. In a SaaS org, this means build software.  
**The Sprint** identifies scope-creep. The Sprint is a process reminder that the whole world does not beed to be fixed, updated, or built, within a few weeks.  
**Sprint Planning** carves out some specific space to translate business needs & priorities to the devs. This reserves non-dev efforts to a small part of the devs work, making the super majority of dev time directed toward developing software.  
**Sprint Review** is the feedback loop where the dev efforts are shown back to others. Sprint Review reminds devs that their after putting their heads down and updating code logic, that their work matters to the broader org and to the consumer(s) of the product(s).  
**The Daily Scrum** is for the devs to have a formal touch-point to communicate where everyone is at in regards to the Goal of the Sprint.
