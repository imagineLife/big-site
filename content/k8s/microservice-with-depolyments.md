# From Sensitive Single-Pod Deployments to Replica Set Resilliancy

In a [previous post](/k8s/architecture-intro/microservice-demo/), a k8s cluster manages a handful of objects:

- 5 pods, each 1 "service" in a "microservice" style application
- 4 services, allowing explicit connectivity between the pods
  - 2 open-to-the-world services, webapps
  - 2 internal-only data stores, postgres and redis

This style of deployment is great for illustrating one "simple" way of deploying apps with pods, services, and kubernetes - for me specifically using minukube and k8s in docker, due to my current M1 mac restrictions and some online suggestions!

## More Pods for Frontend Apps

Here, The frontend-facing apps (_voting-app and result-app_) will get replica-sets through deployments. Deployments will "manage" the replica sets of the pods.

## Comparing Pod-Based Deployments to Deployment-Managed Deployemnts

In some ways, using kubernetes deployemnt objects is "easier" that pod definition files. Deployments at least have more features:

- the deployment will "manage" pods with a bit more automation than manual pod management
- the deployment config file can include the number of replica pods to manage
  - when 1+ pod(s) "dies" in a deployment, it gets automagically re-created by k8s

The deployment of the pods and services is also a bit different between this deployment-managed approach and a single-od-deployment approach:

- in a single-pod approach, each pod gets a definition file and a deploy command
- in a deployment-managed approach each **deployment** gets a definition file and a deploy command
  - the difference here is implicit in that each deployment can have many pods per single definition file!!

## Deploying the Deployments

Validate that no pods or services are running. If you happen to be following along from the previous article, ["A Microservice K8s Demo"](/k8s/architecture-intro/microservice-demo/), The previous article leaves pods & services running. delete them before running these.

### The Voting App

```bash
Jakes-4:k8s Jake$ kubectl create -f cfgs/deployments/voting-app.yaml
deployment.apps/voting-app-deploy created
Jakes-4:k8s Jake$ kubectl create -f cfgs/services/voting-app.yaml
service/voting-service created

# check the deployment!

### worker

```bash
Jakes-4:k8s Jake$ kubectl create -f cfgs/deployments/worker.yaml
deployment.apps/worker-deploy created

# check em!
# NOTE: the worker has no service running - its a pod with no service :)

```

### results app

do the same with the results config :)

## Scaling Up Live!

One major benefit of deployments is that the deployment "object" will "manage" pods, like when pods crash or when pods get scaled...live!! zero down time!!!

### Edit The Results App Config File

The deployment "watches" deployment config files & wiill adjust the deployed pods & services accordingly.  
Here, the `replicas` will be edited in the result-app config file.

```bash
# Edit the result app deployment to have 1 replica instead of 3
kubectl edit deployment result-app-deploy --record

# the config will show in the terminal
# find the replicas line and edit to be 1 instead of the
# :wq! to exit

# check the deployment, see 1/1 instead of 3/3 for the result-app-deploy
Jakes-4:k8s Jake$ kubectl get deployments
NAME                READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
pg-deploy           1/1     1            1           25h
redis-deploy        1/1     1            1           25h
result-app-deploy   1/1     1            1           16m
voting-app-deploy   1/1     1            1           25h
worker-deploy       1/1     1            1           25h
```
