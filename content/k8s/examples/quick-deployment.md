## Create a deployment
- called frontend-dep
- 1 container called `ngingx`
- image from `nginx:1.16`
- 4 replicas
- strategy of `rollingUpdate` with some details
  - maxSurge: 1
  - maxUnavailable: 2

## Upgrade The Image of the deployed replicaset pods
Once that is out
- upgrade the image to `nginx:1.17`

## Rollback
Once all pods are updated
- rollback the deployment to the previous version


## Helpful tips
A One-liner to start:  
`kubectl create deployment frontend-dep --image=nginx:1.16 --replicas=4 --dry-run=client -o yaml > asdf.yaml`  

Don't forget to deal with the `rollingUpdate` strategy bit:
```yaml
# ...
spec:
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 2
# ...
```

The whole yaml might end up looking something...
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: frontend-dep
  name: frontend-dep
spec:
  replicas: 4
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend-dep
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: frontend-dep
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx:1.16
        name: nginx
        resources: {}
status: {}
```
