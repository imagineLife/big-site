Build an image:
- called `my-sleeper`
- runs the busybox image
- in a namespace called `sleepspace`
- call the container `secret`
- make the container only run `sleep 3600`
- set this up so that the pod is scheduled to only run on the `master` node - no other nodes in the cluster
- make the container mount a vol
  - read-only
  - secret
  - called `secret-volume`
  - at path `/etc/secret-volume`


`kubectl run my-sleeper --namespace=sleepspace --image=busybox --command=sleep 3600 --dry-run=client -o yaml > sleeper.yaml`

Update the pod yaml to include the volume:
```yaml
spec:
  nodeName: master
  volumes:
    - name: secret-volume
      secret:
        secretName: dotfile-secret
  containers:
  # ...the rest of the container lines
    - command:
      - sleep
      - "3600"
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /etc/secret-volume
      name: secret-volume
      readOnly: true
```
