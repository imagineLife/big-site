# A simple solution for matching pod deployments to nodes

Set a label on a node:
```bash
# kubectl label nodes <node-name> key=val
kubectl label nodes this-node size=large
```

Set a nodeSelector in a pod def file to match the node label:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: horse
      image: horse
  # THIS matches the node label above 
  nodeSelector:
    size: large
```

## Useful For Simple Use-Cases
This Pod-to-Node label matching node-selector works for clear goals for deploying a specific pod to a specific node.  
The pod gets a `nodeSelector` and the node gets a label.  
The pod with the nodeSelector will get deployed to the node with the matching label.
