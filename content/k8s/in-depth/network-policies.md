# Network Traffic Is Though Of From Where The Request Starts
In a traditional http data-transfer, each request has 2 parts: a request and a response. One unit makes a request to another unit, and the other unit fullfills the request and the http data-transfer "comes back" to the initial requester.

  A["I Want Something"]
  B["I Have What You Need"]
    A -- 1. Request --> B
    B -- 2. Response --> A

## Kubernetes default allow-all policy
Kubernetes applies an "allow-all" networking policy between objects.  
Network policies are used to restrict network activity to & from k8s objects.   

## A 3-Pod Networking Example
3 Servers. Example Ports. What happens when the users wants to use a page that gets data from a db through an api:  

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  user ->> FrontendServer: Req. on port 80
  FrontendServer ->> API_Server: Req. on port 3001
  API_Server ->> DB_Server: Req on port 27017

  DB_Server ->> API_Server : Response
  API_Server ->> FrontendServer : Response
  FrontendServer ->> user : Response
```

#### Another View
Here, actors and request ports.  
Requests, **ingress traffic**, are solid lines with port labels.  
Responses are dotted lines.  

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  USR["End-User"]
  FE["Frontend"]
  API["API"]
  DB["DB"]
  
  USR --":80" Frontend Ingress--> FE
  FE -.-> USR
  
  FE --":5000" Frontend Egress API Ingress--> API
  API -.-> FE

  API --":27017" API Egress DB Ingress--> DB
  DB -.-> API

```

### Ingress and Inbound traffic
Ingress and Egress notes specifically about where dataflow _starts_.  
**Ingress** referrs to inbound traffic, like how ...
- **the frontend** server recieves ingress traffic from the user
- **the api** server recieves ingress traffic from the frontend server
- - **the db** recieves ingress traffic from the api server

### Egress and Outbound Traffic
Egress represents an object _making an outbound request_, like how...
- **the frontend** server creates egress traffic to the api
- **the api** server creates egress traffic to the db


### Ingress and Egress as Rules
Here, ingress and egress traffic are describes by each object in this 3-object diagram in 6 bullet points.  
These rules will translate to the K8s world.  
Also notice - indirectly, the frontend does not "need" to talk to the db server. 

#### Frontend Server
- allow ingress on port 80 from the world
- allow egress on port 5000 to the api pod

#### API Server
- allow ingress on port 5000 from the frontend server
- allow egress on port 27017 to the db 

#### DB
- allow ingress on port 27017 from the api server


### Ingress, Pods, and Services Through Network Policies
Here, a look at the db networking policy details:
```yaml
policyTypes: 
- Ingress
ingress:
- from:
  - podSelector:
      matchLabels:
        name: api-pod
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 27017
```

in context of a more complete network policy def file: the db is being "protected" and assured that _only traffic on a specific port from a specific pod_ is allowed
```yaml
# db-policy.yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: db-network-policy
spec:
  # the pod(s) this will apply to, via matched labels
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: db
  policyTypes:
  # only incoming data 
  - Ingress
  # the ingress description
  ingress:
  # where data can come from
  - from:
    # traffic source pod by "name" label
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: api-pod
      # only pods from the "prod" namespace
      namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: prod
    # traffic source port(s)
    # ...DONT FORGET PORTS CONFIG in a network policy
    # a "default" could be protocol:tcp port:80
    ports:
      - protocol: TCP
        port: 27017
```

`kubectl create -f db-policy.yaml`


### Allow Traffic from non-pod I.P addresses
Perhaps network traffic is desired to this example db pod _from a machine that is not managed by kubernetes_.  
Perhaps a backup server will talk to the db and create backups.  
This will be an ingress connection on for the db network policy:  

```yaml
# db-policy.yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: db-network-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: db
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    # api traffic
    #  matching pod label AND namespace label
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: api-pod
      namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: prod
    # db backup machine
    # matching pi address block
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 192.168.99.10/32
    ports:
      - protocol: TCP
        port: 27017
```

## Network Policies are Enforced by the networking solutions

### Egress Definitions
A trivial egress-only example:  

```yaml
# db-policy.yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: db-network-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: db
  policyTypes:
  - Egress
  egress:
  - to:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 192.168.99.10/32
    ports:  
      - protocol: TCP
        port: 80
```

## A Deny-All Ingress Policy
This can be one way to lock-down network traffic, and require all network traffic between pods to be explicity: egress and ingress.
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata: 
  name: default-deny-ingress
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
```

## Some Takeaways
- Network Policies are enforced by the networking tool (see above)
- Networking Policies are to prevent unwanted network activity - not to enable 
- Networking policies consider _pods_, not replicasets or deployments: this is interesting!

## Things to do
Create a network policy that...
- allows traffic from an "internal" app
- to the "payroll-service" and the "db-service"
  - payroll on port 8080
  - db-service on 3306

Something like this...  

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: internal-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      name: internal
  policyTypes:
  - Egress
  egress:
  - to:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: payroll
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port:  8080
  - to:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: mysql
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
```

[Here!](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubernetes-network-policy-recipes):
- Deny
  - via whitelise

    - apps in a namespace
    - certain ports
