# An Overview Of Resources and Controllers.  
We, as devs, can create definition files for an object, say a deployment. The deployment is **a resource**.   
We, as devs, run `kubectl create` to tell kubectl to talk to the kubeapi-server to make the resource.  
K8s creates the deployment and stored data about it in the **etcd datastore**.  
We, as devs, can kuse kubectl against the kubeapi-server to do things like create, get, and delete the deployment, which will adjust the etcd data.  
**A controller** in K8s does the work of monitoring the etcd data store, and updates the "real" cluster objects (deployments, pods, etc).

## An Example Mock Custom Resource, A Vacation Agreement Resource
Tell Kubernetes that we want to make a new object type, a `VacationSearch` object through a new definition file, a custom resource definition (crd):

### Tell K8s To Learn A New Resource Type
```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: VacationSearch.vacations.com
spec:
  # this will be scoped to a namespace
  scope: Namespaced
  # matches the apiVersion in the VacationSearch object definition file, below
  group: vacations.com
  names:
    kind: VacationSearch
    singular: VacationSearch
    plural: VacationSearches
    shortNames:
      - vaca
  versions:
    - name: v1
      served: true
      storage: true
  # all the fields allowed in the object def spec section
  schema:
    openAPIV3Schema:
      type: object
      properties:
        spec:
          type: opbect
          properties:
            where:
              type: string
              required: true
            nightlyMaxRate:
              type: integer
            ammenities:
              type: ...array...?!
            nights:
              type: number
              required: true
```  

### Create One Of These Custom Resources
Here, a vaca-agreement resource to work with through this custom resource work.
```yaml
apiVersion: vacationSearch.com/v1
kind: VacationSearch
metadata:
  name: cali-trip
spec:
  where: SanFrancisco
  nightlyMaxRate: 150
  ammenities: ['wifi', 'dishwasher']
  nights: 14
```
Say this resource type is allowed in K8s.  
Say we can crud this through typical kubectl commands.  
The ETCD Datastore would be updated with info about the resource by using `kubectl <action>` commands.    
Say we also create a VacationSearchController.  
This controller, this **custom controller** would...
- be written in something like nodejs
- watch VacationSearch resources in etcd
- would make api calls to rental sites, with params

### Create A Custom Controller To Work With The Resource
The Controller will...
- monitor the etcd for `VacationSearch` objects, monitoring in a loop
- perform actions based on the `VacationSearch` objects
- be allowed to be in any code - python, node, go... K8s has a go client, and several other "supported" libraries

One example of a sample-controller is [in the kubernetes github repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller). To build this sample controller,
- install go on my machine
- clone the github repo with the sample controller
- cd into it
- customize `controller.go` to do the work!  
- build the code with go, `go build -o sample-controller .`
- run the code! `./sample-controller -kubeconfig=$HOME/.kube/config`
  - this tells k8s to use this new controller :) 

This controller can be packed for distribution, by something like containerizing it.  
The controller can even be deployed as a pod in the k8s world. Crazy!  

### Use The Operator Framework to Deploy All Custom Resources In One
The Operator Framework can be used to deply the custom resource definition file and the custom controller all-in-one. The Operator Framework is intended to do what human operators do.  
There are many operators already built and available at [OperatorHub](https://operatorhub.io/).   
Operators are complex: there's a lot going on - it is intended to do automation of automation.  

The Operator Framework can do things like...
- Deal With Custom Resource Definitions
  - i.e the `etcdCluster`
  - etcdBackup - take backups
  - etcdRestore - restore backups
- Deal With Custom Controllers
  - i.e the `etcdController`
  - backup operator
  - restoreOperator
