## Pods
Pods are [_"...the smallest deployable units of computing..."_](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/) that can be made and "managed" by k8s.  
Pods may look & feel like a composed network of docker containers that, in dockerland, are all working together under a single `docker-compose.yml` file.  

From a networking perspective, a pod can be seen as a VM of physical hosts. The network needs to assign IPs to pods. Kubernetes does not enable pod-to-pod communication availability: "you" have to do that with network config.  


### One or more Containers
Pods run containers.  
Pods share storage.  
Pods share network resources.  
Pods share a "spec" on how to run the containers.  
Based on the k8s docs,  
[_"Note: Grouping multiple co-located and co-managed containers in a single Pod is a relatively advanced use case. You should use this pattern only in specific instances in which your containers are tightly coupled."_](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/#workload-resources-for-managing-pods).  

### Linux under the Hood
Pods [share linux namespaces, cgroups,](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/#what-is-a-pod), and configurably more.  
This might feel && sound like a docker container.  

### A Pod Definition
A pod [is defined in a yaml file](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/#using-pods):  
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```
That pod
- is running a single container 
- the container is using the docker image `nginx:1.14.2` and
- the name of the container is `nginx`  

A pod can be run with
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/simple-pod.yaml
```

### One Pod for One Application Instance
Scale horizontally === more pods, one per instance of an app.  
_Replication_.  
A Replicated pod or set of pods [_"are usually created and managed as a group"_](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/#workload-resources-for-managing-pods) by a workload resource and its controller.  

One pod, one container (_maybe a norm here_).  

## On Scaling
### Scalability with Pods
One hierarchical look a this:
- A: A cluster, wraps
  - B: a single-node k8s cluster, wraps
    - C: a pod, wraps
      - D: a single instance of a docker container, running
        - E: a single instance of an app

When the number of users grows to introduce a scaling problem? With K8s, a new pod gets created, multiplying the "C" layer and below:

- A: A cluster, wraps
  - B: a single-node k8s node, wraps
    - C1: a pod, wraps
      - D1: a single instance of a docker container, running
        - E1: a single instance of an app
    - C2: a pod, wraps
      - D2: a single instance of a docker container, running
        - E2: a single instance of an app


### Scalability with Nodes
In the previous scaling example, 2 pods are present:
When the number of users grows to introduce a scaling problem? With K8s, a new pod gets created, multiplying the "C" layer and below:

- A: A cluster, wraps
  - B: a single-node k8s node, wraps
    - C1: a pod, wraps
      - D1: a single instance of a docker container, running
        - E1: a single instance of an app
    - C2: a pod, wraps
      - D2: a single instance of a docker container, running
        - E2: a single instance of an app

When the number of users grows to introduce a scaling problem where the number of pods is making the parent "node" stretched thin? Add a node:

- A: A cluster, wraps
  - B1: a single-node k8s node, wraps
    - C1: a pod, wraps
      - D1: a single instance of a docker container, running
        - E1: a single instance of an app
    - C2: a pod, wraps
      - D2: a single instance of a docker container, running
        - E2: a single instance of an app
  - B2: a single-node k8s node, wraps
    - C21: a pod, wraps
      - D21: a single instance of a docker container, running
        - E21: a single instance of an app

Above, the "B2" node can be introduces with even a single pod in it, where room to grow can be introduced into this new pod.  


## One Pod with Many Containers
A Single pod _can have multiple containers_.  
Multiple containers in a single pod are best used when the containers are _tightly coupled_: supporting containers of a primary use-case container.  

Containers in a single pod can all access one another through `localhost`.  

## A Pod Running A Container with an explicit command
### Cowsay and a shell command
Here, a pod runs the cowsay image with an explicity string passed to the cowsay program:
- run `shell`
- pass a string to the shell command
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: whalebox
    image: docker/whalesay
    command:
    - sh
    - -c
    - "cowsay this was run with a command in a container in a pod #TheMatrix"
```
This will output something like...
```bash
  ________________________________
/ this was run with a command in a \
\ container in a pod #TheMatrix    /
  --------------------------------
         \   ^__^ 
          \  (oo)\_______
             (__)\       )\/\
                 ||----w |
                 ||     ||
```

## Parallels to Docker
- deploy an app in a container
  - `docker run api-app`
- **need more resource?** deploy more instances, here 3 will run total
  - `docker run api-app`
  - `docker run api-app`
- **app has introduced a new "service"**?
  - add new "helper containers that link to the primary apps. Here, 3 "helper" container services are added, 1 per primary instance of the app
    - `docker run helper-box -link api-app-1`
    - `docker run helper-box -link api-app-2`
    - `docker run helper-box -link api-app-3`
    - THIS
      - would require shared...
        - networking
        - volumes
        - monitoring of container management

PODS, comparatively, solve the container-linking resource-sharing needs:
- put a primary & helper container in a pod
- containers have same...
  - storage
  - network
  - up & down coordination



## Deploying a pod using the cli
Here, deploying an nginx container
kubectl...
- deploys a container
- creates a pod

```bash
# nginx getes downloaded from dockerhub here
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
```  
### See Pods available
```bash
kubectl get pods
```
- see pods
- see a "status"
  - containerCreating
  - Running

### Deploying with minikube in docker
A brief overview:
- k8s can be running in a docker container
- minikube && kubectl are installed on the host machine (my laptop)

With the command noted above, run that on the host machine && it will start a pod in the k8s cluster that is running in docker
```bash
# again, on host laptop, not in the container
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
```

### Checking Pod "status"
Immediately after starting this pod, k8s will pull the image from dockerhub.  
This will delay the start of the pod.  
To see the pod status, use this on host machine. This is an example where I checked the status frequently until the status changed from `ContainerCreating` to `Running`:
```bash

# the run command
Jakes-4:projects Jake$ kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
pod/nginx created

# getting the status...
Jakes-4:projects Jake$ kubectl get pods
NAME    READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
nginx   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          2s
Jakes-4:projects Jake$ kubectl get pods
NAME    READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
nginx   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          3s
Jakes-4:projects Jake$ kubectl get pods
NAME    READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
nginx   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          5s
Jakes-4:projects Jake$ kubectl get pods
NAME    READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
nginx   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          6s
Jakes-4:projects Jake$ 
Jakes-4:projects Jake$ kubectl get pods
NAME    READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
nginx   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          8s
Jakes-4:projects Jake$ kubectl get pods
NAME    READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
nginx   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          10s
Jakes-4:projects Jake$ kubectl get pods
NAME    READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
nginx   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          13s
Jakes-4:projects Jake$ kubectl get pods
NAME    READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
nginx   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          16s
Jakes-4:projects Jake$ kubectl get pods
NAME    READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
nginx   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          18s
Jakes-4:projects Jake$ kubectl get pods
NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx   1/1     Running   0          24s
```

### Describing a Pod in Detail
kubectl comes with a utility called `describe`. per `kubectl describe --help`, the describe command will...`Show details of a specific resource or group of resources.`  
describe can be used here with a pod, and the named pod we just started called `nginx`:  

```bash
# describe in action
Jakes-4:k8s Jake$ kubectl describe pod nginx
Name:         nginx
Namespace:    default
Priority:     0

  Normal  Started    32m   kubelet            Started container nginx
```
Interesting notes in the `describe` output:
- the name of the pod
- a label assigned to the pod
- the "node" name and the i.p address with `Node:`
- the ip of the pod with `IP:`
- Container info
  - here 1 container named `nginx`
  - where the image was pulled from
- pod (_& container_) event info 
  - list of events happening since pod creation
    - scheduled
    - pulling
    - pulled
    - created
    - started


### Describing a pod in one-line
The `get pods` can be used for a one-liner of the pods, as seen above.  
A "wide" output flag can be added to that command that gives more info in the one-line output.   
Here's a comparison of the `get pods` with and without the `wide` flag:  
```bash
NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx   1/1     Running   0          42m
Jakes-4:k8s Jake$ kubectl get pods -o wide
NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP           NODE       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
nginx   1/1     Running   0          42m   172.17.0.5   minikube   <none>           <none>
```

#### The o Flag
The [`-o` flag](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/#output-options) of a `kubectl <do-something> -o wide` allows for a bunch of adjusting of the output: 
- `-o custom-columns=<cols,here,scv>` can be explicitly described
- `-o json` returns a json format
- `-o yaml`
- `-o wide` returns with a few more columns

The output flag can be used during `get` commands, as well as `create` commands! Crazy.
```bash
kubectl create namespace test-123 --dry-run -o json
{
    "kind": "Namespace",
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "test-123",
        "creationTimestamp": null
    },
    "spec": {},
    "status": {}
}
```

## Deploying a Pod using a yaml definition
Pod yaml definitions have 4 "top" level keys:
- `apiVersion`
  - version of K8s api
  - for pod & service definitions, could be `v1`
  - for replica set and deployment definitions, could be `apps/v1`
- `kind`
  - the "type" of object the file is for
    - pod
    - replicaSet
    - Service
    - deployment
- `medatada`
  - a dictionary with name, labels, etc
  - must be k8s-expected fields
    - LABELS, though, can be pretty customizable
- `spec`
  - some container specs
  - this is "kind" specific


```yaml
# name this nginx-pod.yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: trial-pod
  labels:
    app: my-trial-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-box
      image: nginx
```
Use this with
```bash
kubectl create -f ngix-pod.yml
```
NOTE:
- the `spec:containers:image` is where the full path can go for images sourced from somewhere other than dockerhub - interesting

### Steps
- Create a yaml file with the config above
  - I put mine in a relative dir `<pwd>/configs/pods/nginx-pod.yml`
- run it && check that it is up && running:
```bash
Jakes-4:k8s Jake$ kubectl apply -f configs/pods/nginx-pod.yml
# apparently a pod can also be created with kubectl create -f configs/pods/nginx-pod.yml
pod/nginx-pod created
Jakes-4:k8s Jake$ kubectl get pods
NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
```

## Delete a pod
Here, we'll delete the pod we made through the cli.  
Then, we'll create a pod using a yaml file definition, like above.
```bash
kubectl delete pod nginx
```

Here, we'll delete the pod that was made through the yaml way:
```bash
Jakes-4:k8s Jake$ kubectl get pods
NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-pod   1/1     Running   0          86s
Jakes-4:k8s Jake$ kubectl delete pod nginx-pod
pod "nginx-pod" deleted
Jakes-4:k8s Jake$ kubectl get pods
No resources found in default namespace.
```

## Things to Be Able To Do
SKills this doc covers:
- figure out "how many pods are there in the default cluster?"
    - kubectl get pods
- Create a new NGINX pod
    - kubectl run nginx —image=nginx
- figure out "What Images are used in the containers?"
  - `kubectl get pods -o jsonpath={.items[*].spec.containers[*].image}`
    - SHOULD SHOW nginx busybox busybox busybox
  - OR another way: `kubectl describe pod a-pod-name | grep -i image`
- figure out "what nodes are pods placed on"
    - `kubectl get pods -o wide` will include the node name in the output
- delete a pod
    - kubectl delete pod webapp
- start a pod from a yaml file
  - kubectl apply -f configs/pods/nginx-pod.yml

### edit a running pod
- do something like change the image that the pod container is based on

```bash
# this will open a terminal editor to edit a pod
kubectl edit pod <pod-name>

# this will create a pod def file from a running pod
kubectl get opd <pod-name-here> -o yaml > pod-def.yaml
```

### Get pod status
- figure out the status of all pods && containers
- figure out why containers might be busted
    - a bad image name
- be able to “fix” a pod with a bad image name
```bash
kubectl get pods 
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

## Replica Sets
Interesting note, replica sets can be created against already-running pods.  
Replica sets will create pods that match the `spec:template` definition if the pods are not running.  
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: my-rs
  type: front-end
spec:
  replicas: 3
  # only in replicaSet, not in ReplicationControl
  # assumedly the label as the pod defined below
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      type: front-end
  template:
    metadata:
      name: app-pod
      labels:
        app: nginx-app
        type: front-end
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx-box
          image: nginx
```


## The hidden docker pause container
In a pod is a `Docker Pause` container.  
This is only visible, not "directly" by k8s, but can be seen running `sudo docker ps`.  
This container is used to get an IP address.  
## Some Big-Picture Takeaways
- The "smallest" unit manageable directly by K8s is the pod: not the container
- A pod maybe "usually" has 1 container
  - more-than-one container in a pod should expect the pods to be "tightly-coupled"
- Scaling an application can look like...
  - first, replicate a pod when the pod resources are getting over-consumed. This will replicate a container in a one-container-per-pod setup
  - second, replicate a node when the node and it's pods are all getting over-consumed
    - start with a new node with one pod, leaving room for more pods in the new node

## Using VSCode
The [vscode k8s extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools) does great stuff:
- autocomplete suggestions in yaml definitions
  - after `apiVersion: v1`, the extension "figures out" whats going on and has epic auto-complete suggestions
  - on `spec`, an autopop of `containers: - name:` - NICE!
- formatting syntax
- error-finding & underlining
- the `outline` sidebar section shows a gui hierarchy of the yaml file
