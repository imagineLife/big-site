(_This is part of [a brief series on the fs module](/node/fs)_)  

## Writing Files Syncrhonously
The [`writeFileSync`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/fs.html#fswritefilesyncfile-data-options) method of the `fs` module can be used to write files to disk:
```js
const { writeFileSync } = require('fs');
const FILE_TO_WRITE = './../from-writeFileSync.txt';

writeFileSync(FILE_TO_WRITE,'this is a string\n');
```

## Leveraging Flags For More Explicit FInteraction Expectations
Node has [a bunch of file system flags](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/fs.html#file-system-flags) that can be used to be more explicit about interaction expectations. Here's a few examples:

### ax: Fail When The File Already Exists
```js

// assuming the file already exists
const { writeFileSync } = require('fs');
const FILE_TO_WRITE = './../from-writeFileSync.txt';

writeFileSync(FILE_TO_WRITE, 'this is a string\n', { flag: 'ax' });

// will throw an error:
// Error: EEXIST: file already exists, open './../from-writeFileSync.txt'
```

### a+ Append When The File Already Exists
```js
const { writeFileSync } = require('fs');
const FILE_TO_WRITE = './../from-writeFileSync.txt';

writeFileSync(FILE_TO_WRITE, 'this is a string\n', { flag: 'a+' });
```

## Keeping The Event Loop Open with writeFile
```js
const { writeFile } = require('fs');
const FILE_TO_WRITE = './../from-writeFile.txt';

function writeFileCallback(err) {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log('done writing');
}

writeFile(FILE_TO_WRITE, 'this is a string\n', writeFileCallback);
```

## Keeping The Event Loop Open with The Promise API
[the node fs module has a nice built-in promise-syntax api](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/fs.html#promises-api):
```js
const { writeFile } = require('fs/promises');
const FILE_TO_WRITE = './../new-file.txt';

writeFile(FILE_TO_WRITE, 'this is a string\n').then(() => { 
  console.log('done writing!')
}).catch(console.log);
```
