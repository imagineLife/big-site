# The Event-Loop And Web Servers

Using [the event loop](/node/event-loop) well is critical to building a highly available and performant web server.  
The event loop [is pretty easy to block](/node/event-loop/blocking), so understanding how to keep the event loop unblocked is important.  
To illustrate how the event loop interacts with web servers, below are a few examples.

## A Web Server, Fast And Slow

Here is a simple server.  
It has 2 endpoints, one fast and one slow (named accordingly).

```js
const e = require("express")
const app = e()
const port = process.env.PORT || 8080
const HOW_MANY_ITERATIONS = 3e9

function slowHandler(req, res) {
  console.time("slowHandler")
  // mock a slow, BLOCKING process;
  for (var x = 0; x < HOW_MANY_ITERATIONS; x++) {}
  res.send("server response here!")
  console.timeEnd("slowHandler")
}

function fastHandler(req, res) {
  console.time("fastHandler")
  res.send("fast!")
  console.timeEnd("fastHandler")
}
app.get("/fast", fastHandler)
app.get("/slow", slowHandler)

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`plain-server is running on port ${port}`)
})
```

Try making a few requests through a browser:

- `localhost:8080/fast` will send + receive content FAST. find the log for fastHandler. I ran it 5x in a row and got....

```bash
fastHandler: 9.331ms
fastHandler: 0.934ms
fastHandler: 0.449ms
fastHandler: 0.387ms
fastHandler: 0.681ms
```

- `localhost:8080/slow` will send + receive content SLOW. find the log for slowHandler. I ran it 3x in a row and got....

```bash
slowHandler: 4.661s
slowHandler: 1.537s
slowHandler: 4.628s
```

### An Evet-Loop Blocking Web-Server Process

The `/slow` endpoint above blocks the event loop.  
The event loop in a rest api is one of node's most powerful tools, but when the event loop is blocked the api and node might seem like bad choices gone wrong.

```mermaid
  sequenceDiagram
    participant ClientOne
    participant ClientTwo
    participant WebServer
    ClientOne->>WebServer: 1. /slow request
    ClientTwo->>WebServer: 2. /slow request
    loop Process Request
        WebServer->>WebServer: 3. Handle clientOne Request
        WebServer->>WebServer: 3b. CONSUME the event loop with "slow" handler
        WebServer->>WebServer: 3c. WAIT to start clientTwo Request Handling
    end
    WebServer->>ClientOne: 4. /slow response at ~4s
    loop Process Request
        WebServer->>WebServer: 5. Handle clientTwo Request
        WebServer->>WebServer: 5b. CONSUME the event loop with "slow" handler
    end
    WebServer->>ClientTwo: 6. /slow response at ~8s
```

In the above diagram, node leverages the event loop and the call stack to manage the two requests from `clientOne` and `clientTwo`.

- (1) the event loop recieves the request from `clientOne`
- (2) the event loop recieves the request from `clientTwo`, and "stores" the request in the call stack event queue
- (3) the event loop, more or less, starts the loop in `/slow` handler, blocking the event loop from doing anything else. This is where the request from `clientTwo` has to _wait_ for the handling of the request from `clientOne` to be completed before starting the handling of the request for `clientTwo`
- (4) the event loop eventually finished handling logic of the request from `clientOne` and returns a result
- (5) Node "pulls from" the call stack & starts the processing of the request from `clientTwo`, blocking the event loop from doing anything else. This is where the serverhas to _wait_ for the handling of the request from `clientTwo` to be completed before starting the handling of any other requests (_here there are no other requests, but maybe the point is clear_)

#### Blocking Adds Time To Responses

- "/slow" handler takes... ~4s
- request from clientOne comes in at 1:00
- webServer starts processing clientOne request logic ~1:00
- request from clientTwo comes in at 1:01
- clientOne gets a response ~ 1:04 - ~4s after clientOne request
- webServer starts processing clientTwo request logic ~1:04
- clientTwo gets a response ~ 1:08 - ~4s after starting processing for clientTwo

### A Non-Blocking Approach

```mermaid
  sequenceDiagram
    participant ClientOne
    participant ClientTwo
    participant WebServer
    ClientOne->>WebServer: 1. /slow request
    ClientTwo->>WebServer: 2. /slow request
    loop Child-Process
      WebServer->>WebServer: 3. Pass-Off The processing of "/slow" <br /> to a child process for clientOne
    end
    loop Child-Process x2
      WebServer->>WebServer: 4. Pass-Off The processing of "/slow" <br /> to a child process for clientTwo
    end
    WebServer->>ClientOne: 5. /slow response at ~4.xs
    WebServer->>ClientTwo: 6. /slow response  at ~4.xs
```

#### Non-Blocking Reduces Time To Responses

- "/slow" handler takes... ~4s
- request from clientOne comes in at 1:00
- webServer starts processing clientOne request logic ~1:00
  - NOTE: web-server "hands-off" the processing to a child_process, creating a webserver
- request from clientTwo comes in at 1:01
- webServer starts processing clientTwo request logic ~1:01
- clientOne gets a response ~ 1:04 - ~4s after clientOne request
- clientTwo gets a response ~ 1:05 - ~4s after starting processing for clientTwo
