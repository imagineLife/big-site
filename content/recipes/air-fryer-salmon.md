### Ingredients

- 3 TBSP Soy Sauce
- 1/4C Maple Syrup
- 1/2 TBSP Sriracha (_more for more spice, if you'd like!_)
- 1 clove of garlic, smashed (_pulverized if possible_)
- olive oil spray (_for the air fryer pan_)

### Directions

- **Mix** The Sauce: Soy, Maple, and Sriracha
- **Marinate** Put the salmon and the sauce in a bag. Let sit for up to 1hr, at least 20min
- **Preheat** the air fryer to 400
- **Cook The Fish**: Spray the hot air-fryer basket with oil. Take the salmon out of the marinade - SAVE THE MARINADE! - and place in the air fryer. Cook till a temp probe in the meatiest part of the fish reads 145, up to 8-10 minutes. The air fryer I use seems to cook faster.
- **Convert marinade to sauce**: With only a few minutes left of the fish cooking, bring the marinade to a simmer over medium heat in a small sauce pan. Reduce until it thickens into a "glaze".
- **Serve And Glaze**: Put the fish on a plate. Drizzle some marinade over the fish. Serves well with some starch and/or greens on the side
