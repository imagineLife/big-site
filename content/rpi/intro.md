Besides the physical shortages, raspberry pi sellers have put _limits_ on the number of raspberry pi's a person can buy. I was able to get one through <a target="_blank" href="https://www.adafruit.com/">adafruit</a>.  

## Set Some Goals
Here, I'm thinking of making a little home server setup to host some data and a webapp or two.
