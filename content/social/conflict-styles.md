## Avoiding: Lower Assertion, Lower Cooperation
```mermaid

    Avoider->>Other: I have to go, I can get back to you about this issue
    Other->>Avoider: Ok, when can we plan on connecting about thes again?
    Avoider-)Other: I'm not sure, I'll let you know though
    Avoider-->>Other: low assertion
    Avoider-->>Other: low cooperation
```

Handling conflict with the "accommodating" style can look like a few things:
- deferring decisions to the other's decisions
- **POSITIVE** when stakes are low, and as a way of reducing conflict tensions
- **PROBLEMATIC** when this is a "fallback" style, and you might _really have a preference_. Your preference will likelybe missed, and you may develop a bit of a ["martyr complex"](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/what-is-a-martyr-complex), putting indirect stress on a relationship

## Accommodating: Lower Assertion, Higher Cooperation

    Accommodater->>Other: I'm up for whatever you want to do
    Other->>Accommodater: Sounds good, I'll let you know
    Accommodater-)Other: Great, I look forward to hearing from you
    Accommodater-->>Other: low assertion
    Accommodater-->>Other: high cooperation
```

[The Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode](https://kilmanndiagnostics.com/overview-thomas-kilmann-conflict-mode-instrument-tki/) is the major influence of the conflict styles. I personally learned a bit about the 5 conflict styles through an [online certification from Cornell](https://ecornell.cornell.edu/).
