# The Fundamental Attribution Error
It can seem almost natural to consider someone else's bad choices as an expression of their "core self", their character:
- That person does not volunteer as much because **they are lazy**
- That person **is shortsighted** and spends too much money
- That person **is cheap** because they spend no money

The logical fallacy here, though, is that when _we_ are doing things that seem bad, we are doing them because of _our circumstances and not our character_:
- I'm not cheap, I just only spend on what is meaningful to me
- I'm not a bad friend, I just have a hard time reaching out
- I'm not lazy, I just enjoy relaxing and I'm introverted


This is the <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/the-fundamental-attribution-error" target="_blank">Fundamental attribution error</a>, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error" target="_blank"><i>"...observers underemphasize situational and environmental factors for the behavior of an actor while overemphasizing dispositional or personality factors..."</i></a>. In practice, this can show up in how we judge ourselves and others. When other people do "bad" things, they are "bad" people - but when WE do bad things, it is unintentional, it is not our fault, it is due to our circumstances.  

This is a fallacy, an argument based on a miscalculation or misunderstanding.
