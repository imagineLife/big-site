It can seem almost natural to consider someone else's bad choices as an expression of their "core self", their character:
- That person does not volunteer as much because **they are lazy**
- That person **is shortsighted** and spends too much money
- That person **is cheap** because they spend no money

The logical fallacy here, though, is that when _we_ are doing things that seem bad, we are doing them because of _our circumstances and not our character_:
- I'm not cheap, I just only spend oon what is meaningful to me
- I'm not a bad friend, I just have a hard time reaching out
- I'm not lazy, I just enjoy relaxing and I'm introverted
