## How Impactful Is The Decision?
How many people is this affecting? 3? 12? 200?  
How long-lasting will this be? A week? A month? A Year? A decade?  
For a larger impact decision, involving others during the decision process might serve the decision better than being tyrranical. Hear from others about their opinions. Gain perspective.

## How Much Does "Buy-In" From Others Matter?
Once the decision is made, are other folks going to be "doing" new or different things as a result of this decision?  
Would it be best if everyone was "on board" with this decision?  
How many people within the scope of impact of this decision will not be required to believe in the decision?  
How many people might need to feel "part of" the decision-making process in order for it to go best?
