## How Impactful Is The Decision?
How many people is this affecting? 3? 12? 200?  
How long-lasting will this be? A week? A month? A Year? A decade?  
For a larger impact decision, involving others during the decision process might serve the decision better than being tyrranical. Hear from others about their opinions. Gain perspective.

## How Much Does "Buy-In" From Others Matter?
Once the decision is made, are other folks going to be "doing" new or different things as a result of this decision?  
Would it be best if everyone was "on board" with this decision?  
How many people within the scope of impact of this decision will not be required to believe in the decision?  
How many people might need to feel "part of" the decision-making process in order for it to go best?  

## How Likely Is "Buy-In" From Others?
Am I surrounded by "yes" people?  
Is this an uphill battle from the start?  
What is people's trust in my decision-making like?  

## How Strong Is My Domain Expertise?
Is this ["within my wheelhouse"](https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/articles/what-does-in-your-wheelhouse-mean/#:~:text=A%20wheelhouse%20is%20the%20location%20of%20a%20ship's%20wheel)?  
Is this involving tools & tech that I don't use regularly?  
**What about the folks who are involved in the decision and it's outcome**: how strong is _their_ domain expertise in this area? Will they be able to execute flawlessly? Is this a new tool or technique that is outside the current comfort-zone of them?  

## What Is The Organizational Environment Like?
### How Harmonious Are Personal And Org Goals?  
Do people want the same things as the org?  
Are people's best interests the same as the org's best interests?  
How does individual performance get "judged" in comparison to the performance of the org?  
Would "higher level" leadership's involvement feel _uniting_ or _divisive_ during the decision-making process? 

### How Unified Is The Team In Team-Based Skills?  
Does everyone know one-another well on the team?  
Is conflict within the team resolved in a professional, timely manner?  
Do team members effectively leverage systems to manage time, work, and communication?
