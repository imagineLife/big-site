## Work On What Matters

We can spend our time and money on the things that matter the most to us and to those around us.

## Prioritizing Work is Complicated

- How much profit will a feature earn?
- Which clients voices are the loudest?
- Which clients voices are the most reasonable?
- How much 'technical debt' do we need to address?
- What promises have we made?
- How far-reaching are the items that we have planned?

## Consider Pre-Built Prioritizing Frameworks

[Several Frameworks](#frameworks-are-available) offer pre-conceived attributes to inform priority.  
These attributes, in and of themselves, are only as meaningful as the org values them.  
Adopting prioritization frameworks that offer attributes that are not important to the folks in the org might not help prioritize work.  
These frameworks might instead reveal a misalignment between the org and the prioritization framework, and might even prove the prioritization tool useless.  

### Reach, Impact, Confidene, and Effort
The [RICE scoring model](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/rice-scoring-model/) involves ranking each of 4 factors:
- **Reach**: How broad will this reach? 1 person? a dozen? a hunderd? a thousand?
- **Impact**: For those who will be impacted here, _despite the number of people reached_, how meaningful is this to them? Will this only be a small difference that could be ignored? Will this change, fundamentally, how someone experiences something?
- **Confidence**: How sure is the estimation on the previous 2 factors, reach and impact? Are we 100% sure of our understanding of both reach and impact? Are we only 50% sure on impact but 100% sure on reach?  
- **Effort**: Despite the reach, despite the impact, despite how sure we are of those things, how difficult is this?  

#### Rice In an Engineering Org
I currently earn my living as a software engineer. Despite our best efforts and intentions, engineers might not be the best folks to complete the entire prioritization model. Product owners and other major stakeholders are probably better suited to build comparative metrics around reach, Impact, and Confidence. Engineers may only be best at presenting an estimation on effort required to _do the technical work behind the objective_.  


## Identify Meaningul Weight Attributes

Rendering a Framework useless does not mean prioritizing useless - it just means that the prioritizing _attributes_ are not important to the org, and maybe only at that time.  
Some orgs might value _sales' input_.  
Some orgs might value _internal R&D_.  
Some orgs might value _a roadmap built on stakeholder consensus_.  
Some orgs might value _key client relationships_.  
Some orgs might value _broad anonymous user feedback and surveys_.

## Frameworks are available

Several frameworks exist for prioriting work -

- RICE
  - (Reach _x_ Impact _x_ Confidence) / Effort
- Kano
- MoSCoW
  - Must-Have, Should-Have, Could-Have, Will Not Have
- Opportunity Scoring
  - Customer-Facing
    - ask customers to rate the importance of features in the product
    - ask customers how satisfied they are with each
    - high importance && low-satisfaction = priority
  - Product-Backlog Facing
    - I.D the Currenet-State of the product
    - I.D the desired state of the product
    - I.D the gaps in the product
    - I.D the steps needed to fill each gap
    - weight the cost/benefit of each set of steps
- Buy A Feature
  - With the Scrum Team (_or team(s) responsible for the work at hand_), estimate the "cost" of each product backlog item
  - Get feedback from a team of _stakeholders and/or customers_ on what they value in the product
    - Give each member a budget of play money (_poker chips, monopoly money, etc._)
    - Outline the list of backlog items to the team
