# The Meanings We Make From The Information We Have
We do collect information, and others collect information as well.  
Information doesn't "meanin" anything, though, without...well... meaning.  
Maybe particularly in [Difficult Conversations](https://www.amazon.com/Difficult-Conversations-Discuss-What-Matters/dp/0143118447/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3EGUXM56Q8K4K&keywords=difficult+conversations&qid=1675385481&sprefix=difficult+conversations%2Caps%2C99&sr=8-1) does the meaning we make of information become criticial. Not only the meaning but _how_ we make meaning from the facts.  
[Cognitive Biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) might a strong way to say it - we make "shortcuts" to make meaning out of information.
