## We Gather Information
From sources we trust: headlines, media, news organizations, articles.  
From people we trust: friends, family, superiors, mentors.  
From experiences: similar moments, memories of events that feel the same, [empricism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology#Empiricism) and [pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology#Pragmatism).  
From our sense of reason: what we can figure out, think about, and [rationalize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology#Rationalism).  

### Others Gather Information Too
Pick a topic, any topic - something easy like religion, politics, money, time, power, effort, purpose...  
Surely someone else, particularly in the setting of a difficult converstaion, has some information. Their opinions, experiences, and reasonability all form their own sources of knowledge and information.  

### Our Information Differs
This is perhaps the complexity and "difficulty" of information - that the information differs between the (two +) of us.  


## Approaching Different Information
_more soon..._  
### We Each Make Sense
Have compassion for the other person & people in a difficult or complication situation where information differs.  
As the authors of "Difficult Conversations" say, ["_We each make sense in our story of what happened._"](https://www.amazon.com/Difficult-Conversations-Discuss-What-Matters/dp/0143118447/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3EGUXM56Q8K4K&keywords=difficult+conversations&qid=1675385481&sprefix=difficult+conversations%2Caps%2C99&sr=8-1)


## Facts Aren't Meaning
[_"A Conflict of heart can't be solved with facts and figures; it needs to be addressed in other much  slower and more subtl ways."_](https://www.amazon.com/Why-Are-We-Yelling-hardcover/dp/0525540105/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1675384779&sr=8-1)  
Facts will only get us so far.  
Trying to convince of new or different facts doesn't address meaning that we each associate with the facts.
