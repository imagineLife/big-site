## Each One Of Us Is Figuring Things Out
We Gather facts: **assembling knowledge**.  
We make connections out of the info we've gathered, **assuming meaning**.  
We respond to the meaning, **asserting our will**, one way or another.   
_This type of "framework" comes from [Buster Benson](#reference)._

### We Assemble Knowledge
There is a lot of information out there.  
Consider something that requires action, like which car to buy:
- local dealers may be available for consultations
- articles a-plenty can be found "_the top 24 (any vehicle type) to buy this year_"
- video reviews of cars are all over the web, and the car's ["quirks and features"](https://www.youtube.com/@DougDeMuro) can be entertaining to learn about
- friends, family, and familiar trusted auto brands might also be a source of input (_"...this honda has been running for 25 years and all the bells and whistles still work fine!"_)

Each of these may be "the best" option, and also maby be "missing out" on a "better" option.
#### We Make Shortcuts Assembling Knowledge
- I might need to make a decision quick - reducing the sher volume of input I can handle
- I might only have a limited local set of car options
- I might have social pressure to choose from family, friends, and peers, reducing my options yet again
- I might really like the car I have and might not even consider other brands due to a sense of brand loyalty and trust

Each of these may be "the best" option, and also maby be "missing out" on a "better" option.
### We Assume Meaning
Terms like "best", "risk", "easy"... these things are succinct value statements - 
- I might assume that the dealer with the best load interest rate is the best
- I might assume that new options, with the most new tech with the most opportunity to fail, are more risky than trusty reliable simpler vehicles
- I might assume that a specific drivetrain is best

Each of these may be "the best" option, and also maby be "missing out" on a "better" option.
#### We Make Shortcuts When Assuming Meaning

I might make most decisions based on ...
- the trust I have in my family's input
- the quirkiest and most fun option
- the strongest sense of need and time efficiency to get the task done

Each of these may be "the best" option, and also maby be "missing out" on a "better" option.
