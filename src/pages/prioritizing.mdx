# Prioritization

## Work On What Matters

We can spend our time and money on the things that matter the most to us, to the org, and to the product(s) being developed.

## Prioritizing Work is Complicated

- How much profit will a feature earn?
- Which clients voices are the loudest?
- Which clients voices are the most reasonable?
- How much 'technical debt' do we need to address?
- What promises have we made?
- How far-reaching are the items that we have planned?

## Frameworks are available

Several frameworks exist for prioriting work -

- RICE
  - (Reach _x_ Impact _x_ Confidence) / Effort
- Kano
- MoSCoW
  - Must-Have, Should-Have, Could-Have, Will Not Have
- Opportunity Scoring
  - Customer-Facing
    - ask customers to rate the importance of features in the product
    - ask customers how satisfied they are with each
    - high importance && low-satisfaction = priority
  - Product-Backlog Facing
    - I.D the Currenet-State of the product
    - I.D the desired state of the product
    - I.D the gaps in the product
    - I.D the steps needed to fill each gap
    - weight the cost/benefit of each set of steps
- Buy A Feature
  - With the Scrum Team (_or team(s) responsible for the work at hand_), estimate the "cost" of each product backlog item
  - Get feedback from a team of _stakeholders and/or customers_ on what they value in the product
    - Give each member a budget of play money (_poker chips, monopoly money, etc._)
    - Outline the list of backlog items to the team
