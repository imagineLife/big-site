# Prioritization

## Work On What Matters

[Reference I](https://roadmunk.com/guides/product-prioritization-techniques-product-managers/)
We can spend our time and money on the things that matter the most to us.

## Prioritizing Work is Complicated

- How much profit will a feature earn?
- Which clients voices are the loudest?
- Which clients voices are the most reasonable?
- How much 'technical debt' do we need to address?
- What promises have we made?
- How far-reaching are the items that we have planned?

## Frameworks are available

Several frameworks exist for prioriting work -

- RICE
  - (Reach _x_ Impact _x_ Confidence) / Effort
- Kano
- MoSCoW
  - Must-Have, Should-Have, Could-Have, Will Not Have
- Opportunity Scoring
  - Customer-Facing
    - ask customers to rate the importance of features in the product
    - ask customers how satisfied they are with each
    - high importance && low-satisfaction = priority
  - Product-Backlog Facing
    - I.D the Currenet-State of the product
    - I.D the desired state of the product
    - I.D the gaps in the product
    - I.D the steps for each gap, & weight the cost/benefit of each
- Buy A Feature
