We can spend our time and money on the things that matter the most to us.

## Priority is Complicated

When running a business and building a SaaS platform, the influences are everywhere & this can cloud priorities...

- How much \$\$ will a feature earn?
- Which clients voices are the most reasonable?
- Which clients voices are the loudest?
- How much 'technical debt' do we need to address?
-

Several 'frameworks' exist for prioriting work -

- RICE
- Kano
- MoSCoW
- Opportunity Scoring
- Buy A Feature
