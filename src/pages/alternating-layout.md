# Anatomy of an Alternating Text Image Layout

An alternate text image layout has a few fundamental parts to it:

- **Sections**: The layout is made distinct parts, where each part has similar content types
- **Section Images**: Each Section has an image
- **Section Heading**: Each Section has a heading or title
- **Section Body**: Each Section has a descriptive text element
- **Alternating Section Orientations**: Each section in the layout has an orientation opposite of the previous section: The first section can start with the image on the left and the text+header on the right, where the following section contains the image on the right and the text+header on the left
