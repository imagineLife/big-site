## The Sprint

This is the center of the scrum timeline.

### Less Than One Month

### Consistent

Teams that adopt same-length sprints provide a regular rhythm of releasable value for the org and the client.  
Predictability may emerge from consistent & short-term Sprint

### All Encompassing

All implementations of planning, building, inspecting, adapting, and backlog refinement are encapsulated within the sprint.

### Consecutive

Immediately after 1 Sprint stops, another Sprint starts. There is no down-time between Sprints.

## Sprint Planning

## Sprint Review

## Sprint Retrospective

## Daily Scrum
