## The Sprint

This is the center of the scrum timeline.

### Less Than One Month

### Consistent

Teams that adopt same-length sprints provide a regular rhythm of releasable value for the org and the client.  
Predictability may emerge from consistent & short-term Sprints. The Scrum Guide requires a maximum length of a Sprint to be 1 month.  
**When a Sprint is "too long"**, several unintended effects may arise:

- The Sprint Goal looses its relevance. This can make the releasable increment(s) from the Sprint seem disjointed or confusing
- Risk in releasability increases. The longer the duration a team thinks it will take to release an increment of value, the more relative room for error there will be.
- Complexity can increase. A team may add complexity to items that were done ahead of time. A team may have mis-calculated by _weeks_ on expected releasability of an increment.

Maintaining shorter Sprints enable a few effects:

- Complexity can decrease. Constant consideration of a short release timeline requires tradeoffs between over-engineering to perfection, on one hand, and getting something small and irrelevant out the door.
- Risk can decrease. When a 2-week estimation is off-target, a few days of work may be the cost. Smaller features alongside shorter sprint cycles allow for less risk when results are not met.
- Learning can become a more regular part of the team's workflow. Sprint after Sprint, the team has built-in opportunities to review, plan, iterate, question, and learn from their work, their team, and their product.

### All Encompassing

All implementations of planning, building, inspecting, adapting, and backlog refinement are encapsulated within the sprint.

### Consecutive

Immediately after 1 Sprint stops, another Sprint starts. There is no down-time between Sprints.

### Allow for Frequent Review Of Abilities

Directly from the Scrum Guide, "_Various practices exist to forecast progress, like burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows. While proven useful, these do not replace the importance of empiricism. In complex environments, what will happen is unknown. Only what has already happened may be used for forward-looking decision making._"
