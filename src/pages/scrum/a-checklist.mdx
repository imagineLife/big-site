## Theory BuyIn

Scrum works when all folks involved are ready to regularly interact with some theories:

- [ ] **Empiricism** as the source of knowledge
  - We "Know" about our work by what we do and what we experience, rather than intuition or rationalism
- [ ] **Minimizing Waste** is a priority
  - Scrum has events that can help identify waste, and removing this waste keeps the team and work effort lean
- [ ] **Incrementality** is the way to release value
  - Small iterations of value take priority over quarterly goals, annual themes, and longer-term guessing
- [ ] **Transparency** gives insigth for important decisions
  - The Product Backlog and the current work being done are visible
- [ ] **Inspection** enables regular adaptation and happens on a regular basis
  - Scrum artifacts present the work to be done as well as the current work
- [ ] **Adaptation** allows for handling complex problems while the team learns
  - The Short-Term Sprint allows for new knowledge to make impacts on the details of the work being done

## Value Adoption

Effectuve Scrum depends on participants developing competency in five values:

- [ ] **Commitment**
  - The team is committed to accomplishing the Sprint Goal together
- [ ] **Focus**
  - The team's primary focys is on the work of the Sprint
- [ ] **Openness**
  - The nature of the work and the challenges of the work are known to the Scrum Team and the Stakeholders
- [ ] **Respect**
  - Members of the Scrum Team respect each other to be "_capable, independent people_"
- [ ] **Courage**
  - The team and the members do the right thing and work on difficult problems in order to accomplish the goals of the sprint
