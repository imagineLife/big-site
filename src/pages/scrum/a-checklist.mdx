# A Scrum Checklist

Considering Scrum for your Org? Here are the must-haves for Scrum To Work

## Theory BuyIn

Scrum works when all folks involved are ready to regularly interact with some theories:

- [ ] **Empiricism** as the source of knowledge
  - We "Know" about our work by what we do and what we experience
- [ ] **Minimizing Waste** is a priority
  - Scrum has events that can help identify waste, and removing this waste keeps the team and work effort lean
- [ ] **Incrementality** is the way to release value
  - Small iterations of value take priority over quarterly goals, annual themes, and longer-term guessing
- [ ] **Transparency** gives insigth for important decisions
  - The Product Backlog and the current work being done are visible
- [ ] **Inspection** enables regular adaptation and happens on a regular basis
  - Scrum artifacts present the work to be done as well as the current work
