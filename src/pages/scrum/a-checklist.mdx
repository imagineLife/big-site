# A Scrum Checklist

Considering Scrum for your Org? Here are the must-haves for Scrum To Work

- [Theory Agreement](#theory-agreement)

- [Value Adoption](#value-adoption)

## Theory Agreement

Scrum works when all folks involved are ready to regularly interact with some theories:

- [ ] **Empiricism** as the source of knowledge  
       We "Know" about our work by what we do and what we experience, rather than intuition or rationalism

- [ ] **Minimizing Waste** is a priority  
       Scrum has events that can help identify waste, and removing this waste keeps the team and work effort lean

- [ ] **Incrementality** is the way to release value  
       Small iterations of value take priority over quarterly goals, annual themes, and longer-term guessing

- [ ] **Transparency** gives insigth for important decisions  
       The Product Backlog and the current work being done are visible

- [ ] **Inspection** enables regular adaptation and happens on a regular basis  
       Scrum artifacts present the work to be done as well as the current work

- [ ] **Adaptation** allows for handling complex problems while the team learns  
       The Short-Term Sprint allows for new knowledge to make impacts on the details of the work being done

## Value Adoption

Effectuve Scrum depends on participants developing competency in five values:

- [ ] **Commitment**  
       The team is committed to accomplishing the Sprint Goal together

- [ ] **Focus**  
       The team's primary focus is on the work of the Sprint

- [ ] **Openness**  
       The nature of the work and the challenges of the work are known to the Scrum Team and the Stakeholders

- [ ] **Respect**  
       Members of the Scrum Team respect each other to be "_capable, independent people_"

- [ ] **Courage**  
       The team and the members do the right thing and work on difficult problems in order to accomplish the goals of the sprint

## Role Presence

There are only a few roles required to make Scrum work:

- [ ] **Product Owner**  
       Maximizes the value that the Scrum Team produces

- [ ] **Scrum Master**  
       Helps the Scrum Team and the Organization understand Scrum theory, practice, events, roles, and artifacts

- [ ] **Developers**  
       The folks commited to creating content for the product

## Event Hosting

There are only a few events that make up Scrum:

- [ ] **Sprint**  
       The Scrum Team lifecycle is broken down into a 1-month-max duration

- [ ] **Sprint Planning**  
       Where the Product Owner and Developers decide on what work to do during the Sprint

- [ ] **Sprint Review**  
       Where the team shows off what Incremental value is releasable to others

- [ ] **Sprint Retrospective**  
       Where the Scrum Team plan how they can increase their effectiveness with regards to interactions, prcesses, and tooling

- [ ] **Daily Scrum**  
       Where the developers inspect their progress toward the Sprint Goal

## Artifact Presence

Six artifacts represent work & value, designed to maximize transparency of particular details.

- [ ] **Product Backlog**  
       An Ordered list of items to be done

- [ ] **Product Goal**  
       Describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against.

- [ ] **Sprint Backlog**  
       Where the team shows off what Incremental value is releasable to others

- [ ] **Sprint Goal**  
       The Single objective of a Sprint: a rallying point, a commitment.

- [ ] **The Increment**  
       The Usable “stepping stones” of functionality toward the Product Goal, created within a Sprint.

- [ ] **Definition of Done**  
       The Formal description of quality required for the product.
