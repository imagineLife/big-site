### Adopt the Theories

Scrum (_and perhaps agility in general_) is more than a management framework. Some folks adopt parts of scrum and wonder why their long-term estimations are not any more clear.

#### Scrum is "purposefully incomplete"

straying from detailed process instructions toward relational and interactional guidance

#### Knowledge Comes From Experience

_Knowledge_, about a team, about the nature of the work, about the complexity of work, about the completion of work - knowledg of these things comes from our experience.  
We will not know about work through intuition.  
Our knowledge of the systems we work in is not built-in to our human nature.  
Instead, we will know about these things through our observations of ourselves, each other, and the work at hand.

#### Minimize Waste

Lean thinking is all about maximizing value and minimizing waste. In an org, this could look like refocusing _from_ individual elements or departments or technologies _to_ releasing a wholistic end-to-end value 'stream', no matter how small and incomplete each piece might seem compared to each of it's parts.

#### **Incrementality** is key

Small steps improve predictability. Small releases of value-added elements provide more value than larger long-term complications that have a growing number of 'unknowns' as the project develops.
