### Theory Must-Have's

Scrum (_and perhaps agility in general_) is more than a management framework. Some folks adopt parts of scrum and wonder why their long-term estimations are not any more clear.

#### Scrum is "purposefully incomplete"

straying from detailed process instructions toward relational and interactional guidance

#### **Empiricism** is key

_Knowledge_, about a team, about the nature of the work, about the complexity of work, about the completion of work... does not come from reasoning. We will not know about these things through intuition. Knowledge is not built-in to our nature. Instead, we will know about these things through our observations of ourselves, each other, and the work at hand.

#### **Lean Thinking** is key

- maximize value
- minimize waste
- maybe going _from_ focusing on individual elements or departments or technologies _to_ releasing a wholistic end-to-end value 'stream', no matter how small and incomplete each piece might seem

#### **Incrementality** is key

- small steps improve predictability
- small releases of value-added elements
