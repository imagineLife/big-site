### Theory Must-Have's

Scrum (_and perhaps agility in general_) is more than a management framework. Some folks adopt parts of scrum and wonder why their long-term estimations are not any more clear.

#### Scrum is "purposefully incomplete"

straying from detailed process instructions toward relational and interactional guidance

#### We Gain Knowledge Empirically

_Knowledge_, about a team, about the nature of the work, about the complexity of work, about the completion of work... does not come from reasoning. We will not know about these things through intuition. Knowledge is not built-in to our nature. Instead, we will know about these things through our observations of ourselves, each other, and the work at hand.

#### Minimi

Lean thinking is all about maximizing value and minimizing waste. In an org, this could look like refocusing _from_ individual elements or departments or technologies _to_ releasing a wholistic end-to-end value 'stream', no matter how small and incomplete each piece might seem compared to each of it's parts.

#### **Incrementality** is key

Small steps improve predictability. Small releases of value-added elements provide more value than larger long-term complications that have a growing number of 'unknowns' as the project develops.
