## Thoughts on Scrum

The framework of Scrum is a set of artifacts, roles and events.  
Without the theories and values as the foundations of Scrum, the artifacts, roles and events can end up hollow.  
As the guide reads,  
"_While implementing only parts of Scrum is possible, the result is not Scrum. Scrum exists only in its entirety and functions well as a container for other techniques, methodologies, and practices._"
