## Thoughts on Scrum

The framework of Scrum is a set of artifacts, roles and events.  
As the guide reads,  
"_While implementing only parts of Scrum is possible, the result is not Scrum. Scrum exists only in its entirety and functions well as a container for other techniques, methodologies, and practices._"

Without the theories and values as the foundations of Scrum, the artifacts, roles and events can end up hollow.

### <Link to="/scrum/the-values">Values</Link>

Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect and Courage

### <Link to="/scrum/the-team">Team</Link>

3 role types make up a scrum team: a Scrum Master, a Product Owner, and a Development Team

### <Link to="/scrum/the-ceremonies">Events</Link>

A Sprint, Sprint Planning, a Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, & Sprint Retrospective

### <Link to="/scrum/the-artifacts">Artifacts</Link>

A Product Backlog, a Sprint Backlog, an Increment, and a Definition of Done
