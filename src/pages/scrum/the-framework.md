# The Scrum Executable Framework

This Scrum framework is _how_ the theories and values are executed within a team of folks.  
The Scrum framework, in execution, has 3 parts: team members, artifacts, and events.  
It is imperative that although a team with titles can be built, that artifacts can be maintained, and that events can be executed as written, that Scrum will fail and ultimately be incomplete without the theories and values being adopted amongst folks both inside and outside the team.

## The Scrum Team

The Scrum team is Cross-Functional and Self-Managing.  
Cross functional teams are teams where the members can create value each

### Number Of Members

Scrum suggest 10 or less members to be on the Scrum Team. The small size of the team seems to be optimal for quick changes when necessary, and also get meaningful work done together.  
In previous releases of the Scrum Guide, this had been more prescriptive and specific, giving a range from 3-9.

### Roles

There are 3 defined roles in a Scrum team: the Scrum Master, the Product Owner, and the Developers. Scrum does not define any other roles than those 3 roles.

#### Scrum Master

#### Product Owner

#### Development Team
