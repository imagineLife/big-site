# Iterations, Increments & Releases

## Big Ideas Take Big Time

**Sometimes we have amazing ideas** that we are willing to invest a lot of time & energy into without seeing the completed product. We all know that some of our greatest ideas will take some time to put together some sheet metal and inner workings, to execute on day in & day out, to put the finishing nuts & bolts into, to buff out all the imperfections that came about along the way, and to put on the showroom floor as maybe the pinnacle representation of our work, our time, our blood, sweat and tears.

**The inherent problem with big ideas and big time** is that the time between ideation to release may be long. Uncomfortably long.

This is a familiar problem to an innovative product-building organization, both for realizing idea development as well as releasing value.

## Trade The Long Wait For Releasable Value

Releasing _something_ that provides value to the org and to the client is the goal here. The org can make a trade where the wait for the idealized product is over, in exchange for value-driving content out the door.

**To the idealists** in the org, this might be _painful_.

Releasing an incomplete product without all the bells and whistles, to the futuristic, forward thinking, all-or-nothing type folks, can feel disempowered and let down.

**To the pragmatists** this might feel like great news.

Get something out there. Get some feedback from users.

**To the process gatekeepers** who have been operating in a primarily idea-driven org to incremental releasing, this can feel startling.

An org that has nurtured its processes to maintain a far-off ideal state will not be able to maintain the same processes in an incremental transition.

**To the influence leaders** this might feel like both an exciting moment but also a tricky detail to navigate.

**Previously elusive timelines** now might begin to have more clarity to them, and may become longer than expected. This can be unsettling. On the other hand, excitement can come from having _something_ out in the market to get real client interaction with.

## Release The First Increment
