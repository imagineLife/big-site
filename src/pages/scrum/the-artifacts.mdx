- [The Sprint Backlog](#the-sprint-backlog)
- [The Increment](#the-increment)

### The Product Backlog

- An always-developing representation of work that encapsulates _all_ work to be done by the Scrum team
- Items in the backlog...

  - can be subject to 'refinement', where the details are broken down and defined
  - get converted to Sprint Backlog items when they can be done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint
  - get sized by the developers, sometimes influenced by the Product Owner with trade-offs and clarification

#### The Product Goal

- A description of a state of the product to come in the future
- These can be used as a target for the Scrum Team to aim for during development
- Product goals are either (a) Fulfilled and completed or (b) abandoned and removed from the future scope of work
