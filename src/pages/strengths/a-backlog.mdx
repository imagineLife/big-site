# A Backlog

Some topics I hope to cover

## We Have Talents

I have a tendency to gather information. This has been useful when I happen to have some info that myself or someone else was looking for.
I also have a nack for making a to-do list and getting it done. I poke my head up sometimes, evaluate my to-do list, and put my head back down and get to work, getting things done.

## We Have Varying Talents

My wife has a talent for getting things done through a schedule. This has served her and others well by crafting helpful schedules that help get longer-term goals accomplished.  
I do not thrive with a schedule like my wife does. This is not a _strong_ skill of mine.

A friend of mine has a seeminly natural skill for describing what the future can look like for himself and others. This has served himself and other by contributing to a sense of purpose that connects to something broader than the current details of the moment.  
I do not get as excited, nor communicate as eloquently about the future as he does. This is not a _strong_ skill of mine.

## Sometimes Our Talents Can Seem Ill-Fitting

Sometimes, my ability to perservere through confrontation comes across pig-headedly.  
Sometimes, my attention to potential risk and reserved personality can lead me to seem overly mild.  
These traits are indeed talents, but can feel internally like problems and can be percieved by others as negative.

## We can know and name talents that resonate with us

## There is enough room for you and your talents

## Our Lives Can Be Sourced From Our Talents
