# A Life Of Talent

I think that there are ways to approach life where I as an individual can thrive in life with my 'natural talents'. I don't need to trudge through life spending tiresome energy on getting better at my 'weaknesses'. I can leverage skills, comforts, and strong traits.  
A strengths-focused way of being not only seems to fit for me, individually, but can brighten up the ways I interact with others. When we understand each other's strong points we can flourish together and we can navigate messy interactions together.

## We Have Talents Individually

I have a tendency to gather information. This has been useful when I happen to have some info that myeslf or someone else was looking for.
I also have a nack for making a to-do list and getting it done. I poke my head up every so often, evaluate my to-do list, and put my head back down and get to work, getting things done.

## We Have Varying Talents

My wife has a talent for getting things done through a schedule. This has served her and others well by crafting helpful schedules that help get longer-term goals accomplished.  
I do not thrive with a schedule like my wife does. This is not a _strong_ skill of mine.

A friend of mine has a seeminly natural skill for describing what the future can look like for himself and others. This has served himself and other by contributing to a sense of purpose that connects to something broader than the current details of the moment.  
I do not get as excited, nor communicate as eloquently about the future as he does. This is not a _strong_ skill of mine.

##

- we can know and name talents that resonate with us
- sometimes our talents can feel uncomfortable
- there is enough room for us and others to have different talents
- we can operate from a place fundamentally sourced from talent
