# A Life Of Talent

## We Have Talents Individually

- everyone has variation in talents
- we can know and name talents that resonate with us
- sometimes our talents can feel uncomfortable
- there is enough room for us and others to have different talents
- we can operate from a place fundamentally sourced from talent
