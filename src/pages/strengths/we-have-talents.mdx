## When Connecting Ideas Makes Things Simpler

Alice has an uncanny talent for drawing connections between topics. She'll be in a conversation about a topic & can offer parallels between a current problem and another solution.  
We've talked about organizing databases and Alice has enlightened the room with a connected idea about segregating for security reasons, and the data model was changed.  
We've been building relationships between data and Alice has been able to plant a seed for a one-size-fits-all extraction and the data model became simpler and better.  
These connected ideas have been helpful for getting out of 'ruts' that we haven't even known we were in.
