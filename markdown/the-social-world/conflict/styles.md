## Avoiding: Lower Assertion, Lower Cooperation
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Avoider->>Other: I have to go, I can get back to you about this issue
    Other->>Avoider: Ok, when can we plan on connecting about thes again?
    Avoider-)Other: I'm not sure, I'll let you know though
    Avoider-->>Other: low assertion
    Avoider-->>Other: low cooperation
```

Handling conflict with the "accommodating" style can look like a few things:
- deferring decisions to the other's decisions
- **POSITIVE** when stakes are low, and as a way of reducing conflict tensions
- **PROBLEMATIC** when this is a "fallback" style, and you might _really have a preference_. Your preference will likelybe missed, and you may develop a bit of a ["martyr complex"](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/what-is-a-martyr-complex), putting indirect stress on a relationship

## Accommodating: Lower Assertion, Higher Cooperation
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Accommodater->>Other: I'm up for whatever you want to do
    Other->>Accommodater: Sounds good, I'll let you know
    Accommodater-)Other: Great, I look forward to hearing from you
    Accommodater-->>Other: low assertion
    Accommodater-->>Other: high cooperation
```

## Compromising: Moderate Assertion, Moderate Cooperation
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Compromiser->>Other: Let's figure out how we both get something out of this
    Other->>Compromiser: That sounds fair
    Compromiser-->>Other: moderate assertion
    Compromiser-->>Other: moderate cooperation
```

Handling conflict with the "compromising" style can look like a few things:
- figuring out how both parties involved can "come to terms" with both parties "loosing out" on something. An idealized outcome for both parties is not met here
- **POSITIVE** when a fair, equal, and non-ideal outcome might be the best outcome
- **PROBLEMATIC** when there might be "deeper" desires at hand

## Competing: High Assertion, Low Cooperation
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Compromiser->>Other: Here's where I'm at - let me know when you can join.
    Other->>Compromiser: ok
    Compromiser-->>Other: high assertion
    Compromiser-->>Other: low cooperation
```

[The Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode](https://kilmanndiagnostics.com/overview-thomas-kilmann-conflict-mode-instrument-tki/) is the major influence of the conflict styles. I personally learned a bit about the 5 conflict styles through an [online certification from Cornell](https://ecornell.cornell.edu/).
