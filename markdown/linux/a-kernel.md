## Linux is a Kernel
A Kernel is a part of an operating system.  
The kernel resides in memory. Memory allocation for kernels is usually separate from user-driven content.  
The kernel facilitates interaction between software and hardware. Things like memory (_ram_), storage (_the hard drive_), and networking (_hard-wired or wireless internet_) are "handled" by the kernel.  

## There are many versions, many distributions
The kernel manages some super "low-level" computing details - ["...booting, memory, processes, drivers, and other lowest-level concerns of the operating system..."](https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-linux-and-the-cli/what-is-linux).  
### Ubuntu
Ubuntu is one of the many distros. Ubuntu will be the focus in these linux write-ups.  
Ubuntu is based on the [Debian](https://www.debian.org) distro of linux.  

### Others
[Mint](https://linuxmint.com). [RedHat](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux). [Alpine](https://www.alpinelinux.org), [CentOS](https://www.centos.org)...
