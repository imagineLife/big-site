# Request info from the web 
`wget` and `curl` are 2 tools that can be used to "fetch" info from the web.

One interesting thing about `wget`: it will crawl & download any contents in a document it gets from the web, sort of "recursively".  
## using curl
cUrl is used a bunch.

### Spin Up an http server with python
In this case, the files in the `primary` multipass instance will be available through a browser (_chrome_).  
Luckily, ubuntu comes with python.  
Python has a built-in http server.  
This will turn on an http server.  
The server will make files on the os available through something like a browser url.  

```bash
# FIRST, get the ip of the multipass vm on my machine
ubuntu@primary:~$ ifconfig
# mine returned 192.168.64.2

# NEXT, look for files &/or create a text file in the root dir
# of the multipass vm to serve through an endpoint

# turn on an http server, and make the http server accessible from the host machine
ubuntu@primary:~$ python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 0.0.0.0

# now, the server is available through the browser: try
# http://192.168.64.2:8000/this-file.txt
```

### use curl
With an http server up & running to use as target practice,  `cUrl` can be used in bash to get info from the multipass+python server (_somewhat like a browser getting info from 192.168..._).  
#### use curl in a multipash bash shell
Open a new terminal session into the multipass primary instance:
```bash
# open a new terminal on your laptop/machine
# open a new terminal session connected to the primary multipass vm
multipass shell primary
```

Use curl to fetch the contents of a file from the python http server:
```bash
ubuntu@primary:~$ curl http://192.168.64.2:8000/this-file.txt
# NOTE: the contents of the file you pick will appear in the terminal
```

Making a request to the multipass vm without a file attached to the url (_for me the http://192.168.64.2:8000_) will also work, and will return a list of files/folders that are available.  
#### curl works on macs too
curl can be used from a terminal instance in a mac shell session.  
If you have a mac, you can open a terminal instance and use curl without needed to open a multipass instance into the primary vm.  

```bash
ubuntu@primary:~$ curl http://192.168.64.2:8000
# NOTE: this should return a string that represents an html doc.  

```

#### curl works on windows
I don't have a windows machine.  
Word-on-the-street is that curl works on every windows instance with windows 10 or newwer!   

### Pipe curl output to a file
This will request to the server & put the resulting contents in a file called `localhost-output.txt`:
```bash
ubuntu@primary:~$ curl http://localhost:8000 > localhost-output.txt
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  1158  100  1158    0     0  89076      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 89076

```

### Request only metadata from a server
This will make a "head" request (_there's a bit to learn about http here_) rather than a "regular" request:
```bash
ubuntu@primary:~$ curl -I http://localhost:8000
# or
ubuntu@primary:~$ curl --head http://localhost:8000

# will return something like...
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.8.10
Date: Thu, 16 Jun 2022 12:17:40 GMT
Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 1158
```
Sometimes this can be helpful.  

### Others
use http verbs.  
pass cookies in the request.  
follow redirects.  
pass headers to the request.  
```bash
# use a verb
# NOTE: the http server is not setup to deal with verbs, 
# this request is just to show that curl can do it!
ubuntu@primary:~$ curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000
