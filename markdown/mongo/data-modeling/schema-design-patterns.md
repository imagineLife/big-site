## Schema Versioning

**In RDBMS**, foreign keys can make migrations complex.
Consider converting a scalar 1:1 relationship between 2 tables to a 1:Many, using either a middle-man lookup table or an array, or something else...

- take down the db && update table definitions: could be reformatting a single table that has 3 FK 1:1 relationships to be changed to have MANY more FK relationships, or even introducing a few 'middleman' lookup tables, setting all the FKs etc
- Re-Enable the db with new table definitions

**In MongoDB**, documents could include the version in the doc

```bash
{...document, "schema_v": 2}
```

Each doc, when updated with new data, can also get a new `schema_v` value.

### A Schema-Versioning Workflow

**The Problem to solve**:

- A Delivery "driver info" CMS is present, and the org wants to include a new piece of driver vehicle summary data in a UI. This data will be shown every time a driver is shown in the UI, so storing the data in a `drivers` document will provide great query performance
  **The Schema-Versioning Pattern in action**
- A Schema-version key in each doc
  - The `driver` collections will either get a new or update an existing key/value called `schema_v` to `2` from the current `1`
- **Data-Updating Option one**: The client-side application takes all of the workload
  - the server that queries the driver data can be updated to handle 2 "versions" of the `driver` data - one without the vehicle summary and one with the vehicle summary
    - check for `schema_v: 2` key/val in `driver` document
      - when present, pass vehicle highlight data through api to the gui
      - when _not present_:
        - this will be the initial workflow during the release
        - get car highlgiht data from `vehicles` collection
        - add to server-stored `driver` data and pass to the GUI
        - add car highlight data and `schema_v: 2` into the just-queried `driver` document
- **Data-Updating Option two**: another non-breaking data-updating process can run updates before the client-side consumer uses the new data
  - create a data-updating process that
    - gathers the driver-to-vehicle-highlight connection &&
    - includes the `schema_v:2` key-val in the new driver document
    - writes updates to each `driver` document
  - after this data-update runs, update the data-consuming application to leverage the new vehicle-highlight data
  - **NOTE** the `schema_v: 2` here is not used by the client-side application. It is present, perhaps, more for documentation?!

### Pros

- simplifies DB adjustments
- NO DOWNTIME!!

### Cons

- must accommodate the migration somehow from the "old" version to the "new" version
  - could leverage the schema version, and in application code be able to work with both versions
  - could write a unique app to update the db(s) collections with new data, during a low-traffic time-frame

## Computed

**Never re-compute what you can pre-compute**.  
Optimize when reads are more common than writes.  
Compute-on-write is less work than compute-on-read.

Similar to a view, but including computational results inside the related document.  
Example: for each write, we are doing MANY MANY reads.  
Might be doing the SAME calculations OVER and OVER on read.  
Example, getting summary statistics:

- V1
  - store original data of interest, data about a truck delivery system
  - the application logic does statistical summary calculations every time the app wants read information
  - data gets written to a source db 1x per day at most
  - data get read from the db 20x per day
- V2
  - when storing the data of interest, calculate summary values && store them in docs
  - on read, the summary is already present, reducing CPU usage

## Subset Pattern

Mongodb keeps the `Working Set`, frequently accessed data, in RAM. Once frequently-accessed data + indexes outgrow the size of the RAM, disk accesses start occurring && data "rolls out of ram". This causes performance drops.  
This [`Subset pattern`](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/building-with-patterns-the-subset-pattern) works to engineer what data is stored as frequently-accessed data.  
This solves a problem:
`I need these X docs in memory, but they are growing to be too large.`

As an example, if there are a lot of subdocs that are not frequently used but the parent doc is frequently queried:

- break the subdoc into parts
  - what is frequently accessed
  - what is not frequently accessed
- store freq. accessed details into parent doc
- store extraneous elements elsewhere
  - new docs
- reference the two together original doc and the extra doc
  - references in an arr in the parent to other doc ids
  - could be

## Bucket Pattern

An In-between for 1-doc per piece of data and 1 giant doc holding all data:

- could be 1-bucket per day
- Could be 1-bucket-per-week
- could hold aggregates (_data per hour, data per day_)

### A Bucketing Pattern Workflow

**The Problem to solve**:  
Currently, an org records the time it takes a pizza-delivery driver to pickup and deliver a pizza. This happens on every deliver, and is recorded per-delivery, and is referred to in the data as the delivery `round_trip_time`.  
Each delivery, and it's data, get recorded to a single document in the `deliveries` collection.

The business teams wants a few "bigger picture" insights beyond each delivery's `round_trip_time`:

- what is the **daily average** of each drivers' `round_trip_time`?
- what is the **weekly average** of each drivers' `round_trip_time`?

### Bucketing to the rescue

Create new documents per time-duration average

- perhaps a `weekly_averages` collection, where each document is by driver and week number
- perhaps a `daily_averages` collection where each document is by driver and day number

## Patterns in action

```js
// A data obj with many patterns

// STORES, 10K docs
{
  _id: <ObjectId>,
  schema: <int>,
  location: {
    address: <str>,
    ...etc
  },
  last_weighing: <float>,
  coffee_machines: [0,2,5]
    cups_total: <number>,
    cups_per_day: <number>,
  shelves: [0,2,5]
    _id: <ObjectId>
}

// coffee_cups, 3.7GB of data
{
  _id: <ObjectId>,
  schema: <int>,
  ts: <date>,
  temp_prep: <int>,
  coffee_bag:
    coffee_bag_id: <ObjectId>
    coffee_type: <string>
  temp: <Decimal>
}
```

- schema: schema versioning pattern
- last_weighting: may want to retain last calculated value
- coffee_machines.cups_total: computed
- coffee_machines.cups_per_day: [31], subset pattern
- coffee_cups collection: a bucketed approach
