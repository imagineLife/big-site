# Scrum Values

The Scrum Guide lists 5 values that are required to make scrum work.  
The way that Scrum events, artifacts, and roles are executed are meant to depend on these values.  
Regular recognition of these values being embodied can build trust throughout the team.  
Highlighting, discussing, addressing, and redirecting folks who might seem like they are missing out on these values can keep the team lean and remove impediments to Scrum being fully embraced.

## Commitment

The scrum master, dev team, and product owner _commit_ to one another and the stakeholders that goals will be achieved.

## Focus

Scrum works when the team is only working on the work items that have been committed to during sprint planning.

## Openness

The work at hand, the roadblocks, the successes and failures are communicated and shared through events and documents for all to see.

## Respect

Members of the team share respect for one another as "_capable, independent people_".

## Courage

Scrum depends on the team and it's members addressing the most important topics regardless of difficulty, complexity, miscalculated judgments, individual pride, or precedent. "_The Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing, to work on tough problems._"
