# Scrum Artifacts

The _content_ that a scrum team produces represent work to be done, work that is done, prioritized value, and shared commitments.  
Each artifact has a primary "commitment", a "true north" for reference when decisions need to be made while the artifact is being developed:

- An Increment is commited to the Definition of Done - when an increment is in question of completion, the Definition of Done should be the point of reference for clarity
- The Sprint Backlog is commited to the Sprint Goal - when the sprint backlog is up for grabs, the Sprint Goal should re-calibrate the team toward a shared goal
- The Product Backlog is committed to the Product Goal - when the product backlog is up for grabs, the Product Goal should re-calibrate the Product Owner to clarify the Product Backlog

## The Product Backlog

- An always-developing representation of work that encapsulates _all_ work to be done by the Scrum team
- Items in the backlog...

  - can be subject to 'refinement', where the details are broken down and defined
  - get converted to Sprint Backlog items when they can be done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint
  - get sized by the developers, sometimes influenced by the Product Owner with trade-offs and clarification

### The Product Goal

The Product Backlog is a representation of a commitment toward the **Product Goal:**

- A description of a state of the product to come in the future
- These can be used as a target for the Scrum Team to aim for during development
- Product goals are either (a) Fulfilled and completed or (b) abandoned and removed from the future scope of work

## The Sprint Backlog

- Items picked from the Product Backlog selected to be completed during the sprint
- A plan _by_ and _for_ the developers that represents _how_ the developers with achieve the _Sprint goal_
- Represents as close to a real-time picture of the work that is going on
- Commited to making the _Sprint Goal_ a reality

### The Sprint Goal

- Communicates to the Stakeholders why a Sprint is valuable
- A commitment that the Developers make to complete during the Sprint
- Created during sprint planning, and referenced during the Sprint to maintain coherence, focus, and mindful amongst the developers

## An Increment

- A usable valuea-adding representation of a "step" toward the Product Goal
- Increments are not restricted to 1 per sprint - many Increments can be in a Sprint
- At the Sprint Review, all increments are present
- A single increment can be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint
- Increments must meet the Definition of Done

### Definition of Done

- A description of quality measures required for the product
- Once the details of work meet this Definition, the work creates a complete Increment: when work does _not_ meet this, it is not releasable
- This can be defined by the organization across Scrum teams or by a single team: If this is created by the Org, all Scrum teams must follow this Definition
