# Theory Agreement

Scrum works when all folks involved are ready to regularly interact with some theories:

### Empiricism

We "Know" about our work by what we do and what we experience, rather than by our intuition or by rationalism.

### Minimizing Waste

Scrum has events that can help identify waste, and removing this waste keeps the team and the work lean.

### Integrate Incremental Releases

Small iterations of value take priority over quarterly goals, annual themes, and longer-term guessing.

### Transparency

gives insight for important decisions.  
The "Product Backlog" and the current work being done are visible to all.

### Inspection

Allow for output, particularly an increment (_see below_), to be looked at by stakeholders outside of the details of the work implementation.  
Inspection enables regular adaptation when inspection happens on a regular cadence.  
Scrum artifacts (_see below_) present the work to be done, as well as the current work.

### Adaptation

allows for handling complex problems while the team learns  
The Short-Term Sprint allows for new knowledge to make impacts on the details of the work being done

# Value Adoption

Effective Scrum depends on participants developing competency in five values:

### Commitment

The team is committed to accomplishing the Sprint Goal together

### Focus

The team's primary focus is on the work of the Sprint

### Openness

The nature of the work and the challenges of the work are known to the Scrum Team and the Stakeholders

### Respect

Members of the Scrum Team respect each other to be "_capable, independent people_"

### Courage

The team and the members do the right thing and work on difficult problems in order to accomplish the goals of the sprint

## Role Presence

There are only a few roles required to make Scrum work:

### Product Owner

Maximizes the value that the Scrum Team produces

### Scrum Master

Helps the Scrum Team and the Organization understand Scrum theory, practice, events, roles, and artifacts

### Developers

The folks commited to creating content for the product

# Event Hosting

There are only a few events that make up Scrum:

### Sprint

The Scrum Team lifecycle is broken down into a 1-month-max duration

### Sprint Planning

Where the Product Owner and Developers decide on what work to do during the Sprint

### Sprint Review

Where the team shows off what Incremental value is releasable to others

### Sprint Retrospective

Where the Scrum Team plan how they can increase their effectiveness with regards to interactions, prcesses, and tooling

### Daily Scrum

Where the developers inspect their progress toward the Sprint Goal

# Artifact Presence

Six artifacts represent work & value, designed to maximize transparency of particular details.

### Product Backlog

An Ordered list of items to be done

### Product Goal

Describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against.

### Sprint Backlog

Where the team shows off what Incremental value is releasable to others

### Sprint Goal

The Single objective of a Sprint: a rallying point, a commitment.

### The Increment

The Usable “stepping stones” of functionality toward the Product Goal, created within a Sprint.

### Definition of Done

The Formal description of quality required for the product.
