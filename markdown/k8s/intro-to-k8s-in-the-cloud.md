## GKE
Google Kubernetes Engine.  
Google Cloud Account - get a free one [here](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier).  
### The Free Trial
- 3 months
- 300$ free trial - dunno what that means
- "get started for free" button
- go through all the setup, including inputting address and form of payment (_its free!_)
- an initial "first project" will be made, but ignore that 

### Setting Up K8s in GKE
- open the "navigation" bar
- find the "Kubernetes Engine" item
- A new mini-dropdown will appear, but click on the "kubernetes engine" item, none of the items in the mini-dropdown
- click "enable" (_this may spin for a bit_)
- NO
- click the "clusters" option?!
- try the auto-pilot option, to have gke manage the node for me

### Create a Cluster
Nice: "Ccreate an Autopilot Cluster"
- I set the name to `example-voting-app`
- I set the region to `us-east1`
- click "create" button!!
  - this may take several minutes
  - the cluster will appear as a row in a table
  - click on the cluster to see the deployment details as they happen in a cluster-detail view

### Connect to the Cluster
- navigate back to the k8s cluster list view
- find the vertical ellipses at the right-most end of the `example-voting-app` row
- click that, open a d
- click the `connect` option
- a new modal appears with a few connection options
- Copy the suggested script in the modal
- select the `RUN IN CLOUD SHELL` option
- Notice!
  - `Cloud Shell comes with Cloud SDK gcloud, Cloud Code, an online Code Editor and other utilities pre-installed, fully authenticated and up-to-date.` ([Cloud Shell Docs](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/))

### Setup Pods & Services on the Cluster
- run the copied scrip in the in-browser shell
- try `kubectl get nodes` && see some nodes
- try `kubectl get services` and see the `kubernetes` `ClusterIP` service - this should feel similar to the previous posts about setting up k8s locally in docker + minikube
- Clone _my_ git repo with all of the config files in it into the gke env shell
  - if you are reading this, find me & ask me... or... see previous posts & do some config work :) 
- Adjust the configs of the voting-app service && the result-app service
  - set the type to `LoadBalancer`
  - remove the `nodePort` line
  - remove the `externalIps` line

Create the services:
```bash

```

Notice: 
- the worker app takes a bit to deploy
- the LoadBalancer services have external ips! these are accessible from the www!


### Inspect Some Cluster Contents with GKE GUI
- go back to the browser view, and if the cluster is not selected from the cluster list, select it :)
- select a sidebar item, the `Services & Ingress` option
Notice:
- this is a nice gui option to view & click through the config - similar to the cli
- poke around ,see the pods, deployments, and services!

### Check the app
Find the service `EXTERNAL-IP` addresses for the `result-service` and the `voting-service`: note, they are not shown above but they are present in the GKE.  
Go to those in the browser!! Crazy. K8s deployed in the cloud.  

## AWS
Kubernetes can be deployed on AWS. A bunch of pre-reqs, though:  
### Pre Requisites
See [this link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-console.html) for more deets...  

- AWS Account
  - I already had one setup! #win
- EKS Setup
  - I searched for eks & the service appeared
  - there's an option to "Add Cluster"
- Kubectl util on my machine
  - got that
- Some AWS "General Knowledge"
  - config a cluster role for eks
  - configure an iam role for a node group
  - config a vpc
  - config a ec2 key pair used to ssh in to the worker node(s)

Another post [here](/misc/aws-setup) attempts to get K8s setup in aws. The doc does not complete the task. AWS is significantly more complex to setup than  GKE.  


## Azure
Azure also offers K8s tooling.
