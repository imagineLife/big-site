### Check Out [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&type=image)

Docker hub is something like an 'npm' of docker pre-built images.

- [mongo](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo) (_downloaded 1 BILLION+ times!!_)
- [mongo-express](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo-express) (_downloaded 100 MILLION+ times!!_)
- [redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis)(_downloaded 1 BILLION+ times!_)
- [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx)(_downloaded 1 BILLION+ times!_)

### Running Docker Images

`docker run`
thats the main command.

Here's a more realistic command...

```
docker run --interactive --tty alpine:3.10 # or, to be shorter: docker run -it alpine:3.10
```

Developers might be more interested in RUNNING containers rathe than BUILDING them.

- apline is the flavor of linux being run , sourced from docker-hub
- COULD run `docker run alpine`
  - this would implicitly run alpine:latest
  - try to be explicit about versions being used
- ALPINE IS...
  - tiny linux, has bare-bone necessities for running web-servers

check cur version
`cat /etc/issue`
...etc/issue is a linux file that prints which version of linux is being run
should return `Welcome to Alpine...`

### Made to be ephemeral

docker containers are made to be spun up && thrown out

### docker run shortcut

```
docker run -it alpine:3.10
```

- puts me interactively inside the container
- docker run alpine 3.10 runs && quits

### run a command after starting a container

```
docker run alpine:3.10 ls
```

- ls of the container (the root of the container)

### order of commands matters

- docker
- run (the command)
- flags (--t --rm)
- name of container (alpine:3.10)
- command to run (ls, etc)

### how to clear docker images that are running

```
docker image prune
```

### run a container in the bg

```
docker run -it --detach ubuntu:bionic
```

- detach spits out the hash
- runs container in bg

### attach a bg container

```
docker attach <container-name-here>
```

### kill a container

` docker kill <container-id OR name>`

### Naming a container

` docker run -it --name my-container apline:3.10`

- NAMES the container my-container

### NOTE: cant use a container name 2x

- particularly after 'kill'ing a container
- MUST run `docker rm my-alpine`
